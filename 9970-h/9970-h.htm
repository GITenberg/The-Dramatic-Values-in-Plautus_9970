<h2>Foreword</h2>



<p>This dissertation was written in 1916, before the entrance of the United
States into The War, and was presented to the Faculty of the University of
Pennsylvania as a thesis for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. Its
publication at this time needs no apology, for it will find its only
public in the circumscribed circle of professional scholars. They at least
will understand that scholarship knows no nationality. But in the fear
that this may fall under the eye of that larger public, whose interests
are, properly enough, not scholastic, a word of explanation may prove a
safeguard.</p>

<p>The Germans have long been recognized as the hewers of wood and drawers of
water of the intellectual world. For the results of the drudgery of minute
research and laborious compilation, the scholar must perforce seek German
sources. The copious citation of German authorities in this work is, then,
the outcome of that necessity. I have, however, given due credit to German
criticism, when it is sound. The French are, generically, vastly superior
in the art of finely balanced critical estimation.</p>

<p>My sincere thanks are due in particular to the Harrison Foundation of the
University for the many advantages I have received therefrom, to
Professors John C. Rolfe and Walton B. McDaniel, who have been both
teachers and friends to me, and to my good comrades and colleagues,
Francis H. Lee and Horace T. Boileau, for their aid in editing this essay.</p>

<h3>A R&eacute;sum&eacute; of the Criticism and of the Evidence Relating to the Acting
of Plautus</h3>




<h3>Introduction</h3>



<p>This investigation was prompted by the abiding conviction that Plautus as
a dramatic artist has been from time immemorial misunderstood. In his
progress through the ages he has been like a merry clown rollicking
amongst people with a hearty invitation to laughter, and has been rewarded
by commendation for his services to morality and condemnation for his
buffoonery. The majority of Plautine critics have evinced too serious an
attitude of mind in dealing with a comic poet. However portentous and
profound his scholarship, no one deficient in a sense of humor should
venture to approach a comic poet in a spirit of criticism. For criticism
means appreciation.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the various estimates of our poet's worth have been as
diversified as they have been in the main unfair. Alternately lauded as a
master dramatic craftsman and vilified as a scurrilous purveyor of
unsavory humor, he has been buffeted from the top to the bottom of the
dramatic scale. More recent writers have been approaching a saner
evaluation of his true worth, but never, we believe, has his real position
in that dramatic scale been definitely and finally fixed; because
heretofore no attempt has been made at a complete analysis of his
dramatic, particularly his comic, methods. It is the aim of the present
dissertation to accomplish this.</p>

<p>I doubt not that from the inception of our acquaintance with the pages of
Plautus we have all passed through a similar experience. In the beginning
we have been vastly diverted by the quips and cranks and merry wiles of
the knavish slave, the plaints of love-lorn youth, the impotent rage of
the baffled pander, the fruitless growlings of the hungry parasite's
belly. We have been amused, perhaps astonished, on further reading, at
meeting our new-found friends in other plays, clothed in different names
to be sure and supplied in part with a fresh stock of jests, but still
engaged in the frustration of villainous panders, the cheating of harsh
fathers, until all ends with virtue triumphant in the establishment of the
undoubted respectability of a hitherto somewhat dubious female
character.<sup><a href="#foot1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Our astonishment waxes as we observe further the close correspondence of
dialogue, situation and dramatic machinery. We are bewildered by the
innumerable asides of hidden eavesdroppers, the inevitable recurrence of
soliloquy and speech familiarly directed at the audience, while every once
in so often a slave, desperately bent on finding someone actually under
his nose, careens wildly cross the stage or rouses the echoes by
unmerciful battering of doors, meanwhile unburdening himself of lengthy
solo tirades with great gusto;<sup><a href="#foot2">2</a></sup> and all this dished up with a sauce of
humor often too racy and piquant for our delicate twentieth-century
palate, which has acquired a refined taste for suggestive innuendo, but
never relishes calling a spade by its own name.</p>

<p>If we have sought an explanation of our poet's gentle foibles in the
commentaries to our college texts, we have assuredly been disappointed.
Even to the seminarian in Plautus little satisfaction has been vouchsafed.
We are often greeted by the enthusiastic comments of German critics, which
run riot in elaborate analyses of plot and character and inform us that we
are reading <i>Meisterwerke</i> of comic drama.<sup><a href="#foot3">3</a></sup> Our perplexity has perhaps
become focused upon two leading questions; first: "What manner of drama is
this after all? Is it comedy, farce, opera bouffe or mere extravaganza?"
Second: "How was it done? What was the technique of acting employed to
represent in particular the peculiarly extravagant scenes?"<sup><a href="#foot4">4</a></sup></p>

<p>There is an interesting contrast between the published editions of Plautus
and Bernard Shaw. Shaw's plays we find interlaced with an elaborate
network of stage direction that enables us to visualize the movements of
the characters even to extreme minutiae. In the text of Plautus we find
nothing but the dialogue, and in the college editions only such
editorially-inserted "stage-business" as is fairly evident from the spoken
lines. The answer then to our second question: "How was it done?", at
least does not lie on the surface of the text.</p>

<p>For an adequate answer to both our questions the following elements are
necessary; first: a digest of Plautine criticism; second: a r&eacute;sum&eacute; of the
evidence as to original performances of the plays, including a
consideration of the audience, the actors and of the gestures and
stage-business employed by the latter; third: a critical analysis of the
plays themselves, with a view to cataloguing Plautus' dramatic methods. We
hope by these means to obtain a conclusive reply to both our leading
questions.</p>



<h4>&sect;1. Critics of Plautus</h4>


<p>Plautine criticism has displayed many different angles. As in most things,
time helps resolve the discrepancies. The general impression gleaned from
a survey of the field is that in earlier times over-appreciation was the
rule, which has gradually simmered down, with occasional outpourings of
denunciation, to a healthier norm of estimation.</p>

<p>Even in antiquity the wiseacres took our royal buffoon too seriously.
Stylistically he was translated to the skies. [Sidenote: Cicero] Cicero<sup><a href="#foot5">5</a></sup>
imputes to him "iocandi genus, ... elegans, urbanum, ingeniosum, facetum."
[Sidenote: Aelius Stilo] Quintilian<sup><a href="#foot6">6</a></sup> quotes: "Licet Varro Musas Aelii
Stilonis sententia Plautino dicat sermone locuturas fuisse, si latine
loqui vellent." [Sidenote: Gellius] The paean is further swelled by
Gellius, who variously refers to our hero as "homo linguae atque
elegantiae in verbis Latinae princeps,"<sup><a href="#foot7">7</a></sup> and "verborum Latinorum
elegantissimus,"<sup><a href="#foot8">8</a></sup> and "linguae Latinae decus."<sup><a href="#foot9">9</a></sup> [Sidenote: Horace] If
our poet is scored by Horace<sup><a href="#foot10">10</a></sup> it is probably due rather to Horace's
affectation of contempt for the early poets than to his true convictions;
or we may ascribe it to the sophisticated metricist's failure to realize
the existence of a "Metrica Musa Pedestris." As Duff says (<i>A Literary
History of Rome</i>, p. 197), "The scansion of Plautus was less understood in
Cicero's day than that of Chaucer was in Johnson's." (Cf. Cic. <i>Or.</i> 55.
184.)</p>

<p>[Sidenote: Euanthius] We have somewhat of a reaction, too, against the
earlier chorus of praise in the commentary of Euanthius,<sup><a href="#foot11">11</a></sup> who condemns
Plautus' persistent use of direct address of the audience. If it is true,
as Donatus<sup><a href="#foot12">12</a></sup> says later: "Comoediam esse Cicero ait imitationem vitae,
speculum consuetudinis, imaginem veritatis," we find it hard to understand
Cicero's enthusiatic praise of Plautus, as we hope to show that he is very
far from measuring up to any such comic ideal as that laid down by Cicero
himself.</p>

<p>But of course these ancient critiques have no appreciable bearing on our
argument and we cite them rather for historical interest and
retrospect.<sup><a href="#foot13">13</a></sup> [Sidenote: Festus] [Sidenote: Brix] While Festus<sup><a href="#foot14">14</a></sup> makes
a painful effort to explain the location of the mythical "Portus Persicus"
mentioned in the <i>Amph.</i>,<sup><a href="#foot15">15</a></sup> Brix<sup><a href="#foot16">16</a></sup> in modern times shows that there is
no historical ground for the elaborate mythical genealogy in <i>Men.</i> 409
ff. We contend that "Portus Persicus" is pure fiction, as our novelists
refer fondly to "Zenda" or "Graustark," while the <i>Men.</i> passage is a
patent burlesque of the tragic style.<sup><a href="#foot17">17</a></sup></p>

<p>[Sidenote: Becker] On the threshold of what we may term modern criticism
of Plautus we find W.A. Becker, in 1837, writing a book: "De Comicis
Romanorum Fabulis Maxime Plautinis Quaestiones." Herein, after deploring
the neglect of Plautine criticism among his immediate predecessors and
contemporaries, he attempts to prove that Plautus was a great "original"
poet and dramatic artist. Surely no one today can be in sympathy with such
a sentiment as the following (Becker, p. 95): "Et Trinummum, quae ita
amabilibus lepidisque personis optimisque exemplis abundat, ut quoties eam
lego, non comici me poetae, sed philosophi Socratici opus legere mihi
videar." I believe we may safely call the <i>Trinummus</i> the least Plautine
of Plautine plays, except the <i>Captivi</i>, and it is by no means so good a
work. The <i>Trinummus</i> is crowded with interminable padded dialogue,
tiresome moral preachments, and possesses a weakly motivated plot; a
veritable "Sunday-school play."</p>

<p>But Becker continues: "Sive enim &lt;Plautus&gt; seria agit et praecepta pleno
effundit penu, ad quae componere vitarn oporteat; in sententiis quanta
gravitas, orationis quanta vis, quam probe et meditate cum hominum ingenia
moresque novisse omnia testantur." We feel sure that our Umbrian fun-maker
would strut in public and laugh in private, could he hear such an encomium
of his lofty moral aims. For it is our ultimate purpose to prove that
fun-maker Plautus was primarily and well-nigh exclusively a fun-maker.</p>

<p>[Sidenote: Weise] K. H. Weise, in "Die Komodien des Plautus, kritisch nach
Inhalt und Form beleuchtet, zur Bestimmung des Echten und Unechten in den
einzelnen Dichtungen" (Quedlinburg, 1866), follows hard on Becker's heels
and places Plautus on a pinnacle of poetic achievement in which we
scarcely recognize our apotheosized laugh-maker. Every passage in the
plays that is not artistically immaculate, that does not conform to the
uttermost canons of dramatic art, is unequivocally damned as "unecht." In
his Introduction (p. 4) Weise is truly eloquent in painting the times and
significance of our poet. With momentary insight he says: "Man hat an ihm
eine immer frische und nie versiegende Fundgrabe des &auml;chten Volkswitzes."
But this is soon marred by utterances such as (p. 14): "F&auml;nde sich also in
der Zahl der Plautinischen Komodien eine Partie, die mit einer andern in
diesen Hinsichten in bedeutendem Grade contrastirte, so konnte man sicher
schliessen, dass beide nicht von demselben Verfasser sein k&ouml;nnten." He
demands from Plautus, as <i>ein wahrer Poet</i>, "Congruenz, und richtige
innere Logik &lt;und&gt; harmonische Construction" (p. 12), and finally declares
(p. 22): "Interesse, Character, logischer Bau in der Zusammensetzung,
Naturlichkeit der Sprache und des Witzes, Rythmus und antikes Idiom des
Ausdrucks werden die Kriterien sein mussen, nach dem wir uber die
Vortrefflichkeit und Plautinit&auml;t plautinischer St&uuml;cke zu entscheiden
haben."</p>

<p>On this basis he ruthlessly carves out and discards as "unecht" every
passage that fails to conform to his amazing and extravagant ideals, in
the belief that "der &auml;chte Meister Plautus konnte nur Harmonisches, nur
Vernunftiges, nur Logisches, nur relativ Richtiges dichten" (p. 79),
though even Homer nods. The <i>Mercator</i> is banned <i>in toto</i>. To be sure,
Weise somewhat redeems himself by the statement (p. 29 f.): "Plautus
bezweckte ... lediglich nur die eigentliche und wirksamste Belustigung des
Publicums." But how he reconciles this with his previously quoted
convictions and with the declaration (p. 16): "Plautus ist ein sehr
religioser, sehr moralischer Schriftsteller," it is impossible to grasp,
until we recall that the author is a German.</p>

<p>[Sidenote: Langen] Such criticism stultifies itself and needs no
refutation; certainly not here, as P. Langen in his <i>Plautinische Studien</i>
(<i>Berliner Studien</i>, 1886; pp. 90-91) has conclusively proved that the
inconsistent is a feature absolutely germane to Plautine style, and has
collected an overwhelming mass of "Widerspruche, Inkonsequenzen und
psychologische Unwahrscheinlichkeiten" that would question the
"Plautinity" of every other line, were we to follow Weise's precepts.
Langen too uses the knife, but with a certain judicious restraint.</p>

<p>We insist that the attempt to explain away every inconsistency as spurious
is a sorry refuge.</p>

<p>[Sidenote: Langrehr] Langrehr in <i>Miscellanea Philologica</i> (Gottingen,
1876), under the caption <i>Plautina</i><sup><a href="#foot18">18</a></sup> gives vent to further solemn
Teutonic carpings at the plot of the <i>Epidicus</i> and argues the play a
<i>contaminatio</i> on the basis of the double intrigue. He is much exercised
too over the mysterious episode of 'the disappearing flute-girl.'</p>

<p>Langen, who is in the main remarkably sane, refutes these conclusions
neatly.<sup><a href="#foot19">19</a></sup> How Weise and his confr&egrave;res argue Plautus such a super-poet,
in view of the life and education of the public to whom he catered, let
alone the evidence of the plays themselves, and their author's status as
mere translator and adapter, must remain an insoluble mystery. The simple
truth is that a playwright such as Plautus, having undertaken to feed a
populace hungry for amusement, ground out plays (doubtless for a
living),<sup><a href="#foot20">20</a></sup> with a wholesome disregard for niceties of composition,
provided only he obtained his <i>sine qua non</i>--the laugh.<sup><a href="#foot21">21</a></sup></p>

<p>[Sidenote: Lessing] In our citation of opinions we must not overlook that
impressive mile-stone in the history of criticism, the discredited but
still great Lessing. In his "Abhandlung von dem Leben und den Werken des
M. Accius Plautus" Lessing deprecates the harsh judgment of Horace and
later detractors of our poet in modern times. Lessing idealizes him as the
matchless comic poet. That the <i>Captivi</i> is "das vortrefflichste St&uuml;ck,
welches jemals auf den Schauplatz gekommen ist," as Lessing declares in
the Preface to his translation of the play, is an utterance that leaves us
gasping.</p>

<p>[Sidenote: Dacier] But Lessing's idea of the purpose of comedy is a
combination of Aristotelian and mid-Victorian ideals: "die Sitten der
Zuschauer zu bilden und zu bessern, ... wenn sie n&auml;mlich das Laster
allezeit ungl&uuml;cklich und die Tugend am Ende gl&uuml;cklich sein l&auml;sst."<sup><a href="#foot22">22</a></sup> It
is on the basis of this premise that he awards the comic crown to the
<i>Cap.</i><sup><a href="#foot23">23</a></sup> His extravagant encomium called forth from a contemporary a
long controversial letter which Lessing published in the second edition
with a reply so feeble that he distinctly leaves his adversary the honors
of the field. How much better the diagnosis of Madame Dacier, who is
quoted by Lessing! In the introduction to her translations of the
<i>Amphitruo</i>, <i>Rudens</i> and <i>Epidicus</i> (issued in 1683), she apologizes for
Plautus on the ground that he had to win approval for his comedies from an
audience used to the ribaldry of the <i>Saturae</i>.</p>

<p>[Sidenote: Lorenz] Lorenz in his introductions to editions of the <i>Most.</i>
and <i>Pseud.</i> is another who seems to be carried away by the unrestrained
enthusiasm that often affects scholars oversteeped in the lore of their
author. Faults are dismissed as merely "Kleine Unwahrscheinlichkeiten"
(Introd. <i>Ps.</i>, p. 26, N. 25.) "Jeder Leser," says he, "&lt;wird gewiss&gt;
darin beistimmen, dass ... der erste Act &lt;des <i>Pseudolus</i>&gt; eine so
gelungene Exposition darbietet, wie sie die dramatische Poesie nur
aufweisen kann." Such a statement must fall, by weight of exaggeration. In
appreciation of the portrayal of the name-part he continues: "Mit welch'
&uuml;berw&auml;ltigender Herrschaft tritt hier gleich die meisterhaft geschilderte
Hauptperson hervor! Welche packende Kraft, welche hinreissende <i>verve</i>
liegt in dem reichen Dialoge, der wie beseelt von der feurigen Energie des
begabten Menschen, der ihn lenkt, fr&ouml;hlich rauschend dahin eilt,
&uuml;bersprudelnd von einer Fulle erheiternder Scherze und schillernder
Spielereien!"</p>

<p>In curious contrast to this fulsome outpouring stands the expressed belief
of Lamarre<sup><a href="#foot24">24</a></sup> that the character of Ballio overshadows that of Pseudolus.
In support of this view he cites Cicero (<i>Pro Ros. Com.</i> 7.20), who
mentions that Roscius chose to play Ballio.</p>

<p>Lorenz in his enthusiasm exalts the <i>Epid.</i> to an ideal of comic
excellence (Introd. <i>Ps.</i> p. 27). He even goes so far as to contend that
Plautus lives up to the following characterization:<sup><a href="#foot25">25</a></sup> "Nicht blos durch
naturgetreue and lebhafte Charakterschilderungen und durch eine komisch
gehaltene, aber die Grenzen des Wahrscheinlichen und des Grazi&ouml;sen nicht
&uuml;berschreitende Zeichnung des t&auml;glichen Lebens soll der Dichter des
Lustspiels seine Zuschauer interessiren und ihr heiteres Gel&auml;chter
hervorrufen, sondern auch so reiche Anwendung zu geben, durch die es in
den Dienst einer sittlichen Idee tritt, und so gleichsam die moralische
Atmosph&auml;re ... zu reinigen."</p>

<p>Such emotional superlatives merely create in the reader a cachinnatory
revulsion. Yes, Plautus was great, but he was great in a far different
way. He approached the Rabelaisian. It is doubtful if "die Grenzen des
Grazi&ouml;sen" lay within his purview at all.</p>

<p>[Sidenote: Lamarre] The treatment of Lamarre cited above contains<sup><a href="#foot26">26</a></sup> a
highly meritorious analysis of the Plautine characters, discussed largely
as a reflection of the times and people, both of New Comedy and of
Plautus, without imputing to our poet too serious motives of subtle
portrayal. But he too ascribes to Plautus a latent moral purpose: "En
faisant rire, il veut corriger"!<sup><a href="#foot27">27</a></sup></p>

<p>[Sidenote: Naudet] This sounds ominously like an echo from Naudet<sup><a href="#foot28">28</a></sup> who,
in the course of lauding Plautus' infinite invention and variety of
embroidery, would translate him into a zealous social reformer by saying:
"L'auteur se proposait de faire beaucoup rire les spectateurs, mais il
voulait aussi qu'ils se corrigeassent en riant." All this is
disappointing. We should have expected Gallic esprit to rise superior to
such banality.</p>

<p>[Sidenote: LeGrand] The celebrity of French criticism is somewhat redeemed
by LeGrand in his monumental work entitled <i>Daos Tableau de la comedie
grecque pendant la periode dite nouvelle</i> (Annales de l'Universit&eacute; de
Lyon, 1910), in the conclusion to the chapter on 'Intentions didactiques
et valeur morale' (Part III, Chap. I, page 583): "Tout compte fait, au
point de vue moral, la &nu;&#x03AD;&alpha; dut &ecirc;tre inoffensive (en son temps)."
This is the culmination of a calm, dispassionate discussion and analysis
of the extant remains of New Comedy and <i>Palliatae</i>.</p>

<p>Even Ritschl fails to escape the taint of degrading Plautus to the status
of a petty moralizer<sup><a href="#foot29">29</a></sup>. In particular, he lauds the <i>Aul</i> unreservedly
as a <i>chef d'oeuvre</i> of character delineation and pronounces it
immeasurably superior to Moli&egrave;re's imitation, "L'Avare."<sup><a href="#foot30">30</a></sup> This whole
critique, while interesting, falls into the prevailing trend of imputing
to Plautus far too high a plane of dramatic artistry.<sup><a href="#foot31">31</a></sup></p>

<p>[Sidenote: Langen] Indeed, Langen has already scored Ritschl on this very
point in remarking<sup><a href="#foot32">32</a></sup> that Ritschl's condemnation of an alleged defect in
the <i>Cas</i><sup><a href="#foot33">33</a></sup> implies much too favorable an estimate of Plautus' artistic
worth, as the defects cited are represented as something isolated and
remarkable, whereas they are characteristic of Plautine comedy. Langen
still displays clear-headed judgment when he says of the <i>Miles</i><sup><a href="#foot34">34</a></sup>:
"Wenn die Farben so stark aufgetragen werden, hort jede Feinhet der
Charakterzeichnung auf und bereinem Dichter, der sich dies gestattet, darf
man bezuglich der Charakterschilderungen nicht zu viele Anspruche machen.
Es ist sehr wahrscheinlich dass Plautus mit Rucksicht auf den Geschmack
<i>eines</i> Publikums die Zuge des Originals sehr vergrobert hat."</p>

<p>But Langen fails to follow this splendid lead. Without taking advantage of
the license that he himself offers the poet, he severely condemns<sup><a href="#foot35">35</a></sup>, the
scene in which Periplecomenus shouts out to Philocomasium so loudly that
the soldier's household could not conceivably help hearing, whereas he is
supposed to be conveying secret information.<sup><a href="#foot36">36</a></sup> If carried out in a
broadly farcical spirit, the scene becomes potentially amusing.</p>

<p>[Sidenote: Mommsen] Mommsen in his <i>History</i><sup><a href="#foot37">37</a></sup>, in the course of an
interesting discussion on <i>palliatae</i> and their Greek originals, has a far
saner point of view. He says of the authors of New Comedy, "They wrote not
like Eupolis and Aristophanes for a great nation; but rather for a
cultivated society which spent its time ... in guessing riddles and
playing at charades.... Even in the dim Latin copy, through which we
chiefly know it, the grace of the original is not wholly obliterated. &lt;In
<i>palliatae</i>&gt; persons and incidents seem capriciously or carelessly
shuffled as in a game of cards; in the original a picture from life, it
became in the reproduction a caricature."</p>

<p>Naturally we are not concerned with any consideration of the value of his
estimate of New Comedy. Assuredly he rates it too highly, as later
investigations have indicated.<sup><a href="#foot38">38</a></sup> But here for the first time we are able
to quote a well-balanced appreciation of some essential features of
Plautine drama: a "capricious shuffling of incidents" and "caricature." In
fact it will be our endeavor to show that the <i>palliata</i> was not a true
art form, but merely an outer shell or mold into which Plautus poured his
stock of witticisms.</p>

<p>[Sidenote: Korting] Still more trenchant is the conclusion of Korting in
his <i>Geschichte des griechischen und r&ouml;mischen Theaters</i> (P. 218 ff.):
"Die neue attische Kom&ouml;die und folglich auch ihr Abklatsch, die romische
Palliata, war nicht ein Lustspiel im h&ouml;chsten, im sittlichen Sinne des
Wortes, sondern ein blosses Unterhaltungsdrama. Am&uuml;sieren wollten die
Kom&ouml;diendichter, nichts weiter. Jedes h&ouml;here Streben lag ihnen fern. Wohl
spickten sie ihre Lustspiele mit moralischen Sentenzen.... Aber die
sch&ouml;nen Sentenzen sind eben nur Zierat, sind nur Verbramung einer in ihrem
Kerne und Wesen durch und durch unsittlichen Dichtung ... Mit der
Wahrscheinlichkeit der Handlung wird es sehr leicht genommen: die
seltsamsten Zuf&auml;lle werden als so ziemlich selbstverst&auml;ndliche
M&ouml;glichkeiten hingestellt ... Es ginge das noch an, wenn wir in eine
phantastische M&auml;rchenwelt gef&uuml;hrt werden, in welcher am Ende auch das
Wunderbarste m&ouml;glich ist, aber nein! es wird uns zugemutet, &uuml;berzeugt zu
sein, dass alles mit nat&uuml;rlichen Dingen zugehe.</p>

<p>"Alles in allem genommen, ist an dieser Kom&ouml;die, abgesehen von ihrer
formal musterhaften Technik, herzlich wenig zu bewundern.... An
Zweideutigkeiten, Obsc&ouml;nit&auml;ten, Schimpfscenen ist &Uuml;berfluss vorhanden."</p>

<p>With admirable clarity of vision, Korting has spied the vital spot and
illuminated it with the word "Unterhaltungsdrama." That amusement was the
sole aim of the comic poets we firmly believe. But if this was so, why
arraign them on the charge of trying to convince us that everything is
happening in a perfectly natural manner? The outer form to be sure is that
of everyday life, but this is no proof that the poets demanded of their
audiences a belief in the verisimilitude of the events depicted. Can we
have no fantastic fairyland without some outlandish accompaniment such as
a chorus garbed as birds or frogs? But we reserve fuller discussion of
this point until later. We might suggest an interesting comparison to the
nonsense verse of W. S. Gilbert, which represents the most shocking ideas
in a style even nonchalantly matter-of-fact. Does Gilbert by any chance
actually wish us to believe that "Gentle Alice Brown," in the poem of the
same name, really assisted in "cutting up a little lad"?</p>

<p>Korting regains his usual clear-headedness in pronouncing 'that there is
little in the technique of <i>palliatae</i> to excite our admiration.' Again we
insist (to borrow the jargon of the modern dramatic critic) it was but a
"vehicle" for popular amusement.</p>

<p>[Sidenote: Schlegel] Wilhelm Schlegel, in his <i>History of the Drama</i><sup><a href="#foot39">39</a></sup>
has the point of view of the dramatic critic, rather than the professional
scholar; while expressing a measure of admiration for the significance of
Plautus in literature, he is impelled to say: "The bold, coarse style of
Plautus and his famous jokes, savour of his familiarity with the vulgar
... &lt;He&gt; mostly inclines to the farcical, to overwrought and often
disgusting drollery." This is doubtless true, but, by making the
incidental a criterion for the whole, it gives a gross misconception to
one that has not read Plautus.</p>

<p>[Sidenote: Donaldson] J. W. Donaldson, in his lectures on the Greek
theatre<sup><a href="#foot40">40</a></sup>, has plagiarized Schlegel practically <i>verbatim</i>, while giving
the scantest credit to his source. His work thus loses value, as being a
mere echo, or compilation of second-hand material.</p>

<p>We learn from Schlegel that Goethe was so enamored of ancient comedy that
he enthusiastically superintended the translation and production of plays
of Plautus and Terence. Says Schlegel<sup><a href="#foot41">41</a></sup>: "I once witnessed at Weimar a
representation of the <i>Adelphi</i> of Terence, entirely in ancient costume,
which, under the direction of Goethe, furnished us a truly Attic evening."</p>

<p>[Sidenote: Scott] In this connection the opinion of Sir Walter Scott may
be interesting. He too, not being a classical scholar <i>par excellence</i>,
may be better equipped for sound judgment. In the introduction to Dryden's
<i>Amphitryon</i> he says: "Plautus ... left us a play on the subject of
Amphitryon which has <i>had the honour</i> to be deemed worthy of imitation by
Moli&egrave;re and Dryden. It cannot be expected that the plain, blunt and
inartificial style of so rude an age should bear any comparison with that
of the authors who enjoyed the highest advantages of the polished times to
which they were an ornament." There speaks the sophisticated and conscious
literary technician!<sup><a href="#foot42">42</a></sup></p>

<p>[Sidenote: LeGrand] The most comprehensive and judicious estimate of all
is certainly attained by LeGrand in <i>Daos</i>.<sup><a href="#foot43">43</a></sup> He appreciates clearly
that "la nouvelle com&eacute;die n'a pas &eacute;t&eacute;, en toute circonstance stance, une
com&eacute;die distingu&eacute;e. Elle n'a pas d&eacute;daign&eacute; constamment la farce et le gros
rire."<sup><a href="#foot44">44</a></sup> How much more then would this apply to <i>palliatae</i>!</p>

<p>We now believe that we have on hand a sufficiently large volume of
criticism to appreciate practically every phase of judgment to which
Plautus has been subjected.<sup><a href="#foot45">45</a></sup> The ancients overrated him stylistically,
but he was a man of their own people. Men such as Becker, Weise, Lorenz
and Langrehr have proceeded upon a distinctly exaggerated ideal of
Plautus' eminence as a master dramatic craftsman and literary artist and
therefore have amputated with the cry of "Spurious!" everything that
offends their ideal. Lessing is obsessed with too high an estimate of the
<i>Captivi</i>. Lamarre, Naudet and Ritschl commit the error of imputing to our
poet a moral purpose. Schlegel and Scott deprecate the crudity of his wit
without an adequate appreciation of its sturdy and primeval robustness.
Langen, Mommsen, Korting and LeGrand approach a keen estimate of his
inconsistencies and his single-minded purpose of entertainment, but
Korting accuses him of attempting to create an illusion of life while
aiming solely at provoking laughter.</p>

<p>From this heterogeneous mass of diversified criticism we glean the
prevailing idea that Plautus is lauded or condemned according to his
conformity or non-conformity to some preconceived standard of comedy
situate in the critic's mind, without a consideration of the poet's
original purpose. We must seriously propound the question as to how far a
grave injustice has been done him almost universally in criticising him
for what he does not pretend to be. Did Plautus himself suffer from any
illusion that his plays were constructed with cogent and consummate
technique? Did he for a single instant imagine himself the inspired
reformer of public morality? Did he believe that his style was elegant and
polished? Indeed, he must have effected an appreciable refinement of the
vernacular of his age to produce his lively verse, but without losing the
robust vitality of "Volkswitz." Or is it true that nothing further than
amusement lay within his scope?</p>

<p>If so, we may at least posit that almost unbounded license must be allowed
the pen which aims simply to raise a laugh. We do not fulminate against a
treatise on Quaternions because it lacks humor. If the drawings of
cartoonists are anatomically incorrect, we are smilingly indulgent. Do we
condemn a vaudeville skit for not conforming to the Aristotelian code of
dramatic technique? Assuredly we do not rise in disgust from a musical
comedy because "in real life" a bevy of shapely maidens in scant attire
never goes tripping and singing blithely though the streets. If then we
can establish that Plautus regarded his adapted dramas merely as a rack on
which to hang witticisms, merely as a medium for laugh-provoking sallies
and situations, we have at once Plautus as he pretended to be, and in
large measure the answer to the original question: "What manner of drama
is this?"</p>

<p>We say only "in large measure," because it is part of our endeavor to
settle accurately the position of our author in the dramatic scale,
considered of necessity from the modern viewpoint. We cannot believe that
he had any pretensions to refined art in play building, or rather
rebuilding, or to any superficial elegance of style, or to any moralizing
pose. We believe him an entertainer pure and simple, who never restricted
himself in his means except by the outer conventions and form of the Greek
New Comedy and the Roman stage, provided his single aim, that of affording
amusement, was attained. To establish this belief, and at the same time to
interpret accurately the nature of his plays and the means and effect of
their production, is our thesis.</p>

<p>If then we run the gamut of the dramatic scale, we observe that as we
descend from the higher forms, such as tragedy, psychological drama and
"straight comedy," to the lower, such as musical comedy and burlesque, the
license allowed playwright and actor increases so radically that we have a
difference of kind rather than of degree. Certain conventions of course
are common to all types. The "missing fourth side" of the room is a
commonplace recognized by all. If we ourselves are never in the habit of
communicating the contents of our letters, as we write, to a doubtless
appreciative atmosphere, we never cavil at such an act on the stage. The
stage whisper and aside, too, we accept with benevolent indulgence; but it
is worth noting that in the attempted verisimilitude of the modern
"legitimate" drama, the aside has well nigh vanished. As we go down the
scale through light comedy and broad farce these conventions multiply
rapidly.</p>

<p>With the introduction of music come further absurdities. Melodious voicing
of our thoughts is in itself essentially unnatural, to say the least.
Grand opera, great art form as it may be, is hopelessly artificial.
Indeed, so far is it removed from the plane of every day existence that we
are rudely jolted by the introduction of too commonplace a thought, as
when Sharpless in the English version of "Madame Butterfly" warbles
mellifluously: "Highball or straight?" And when we reach musical comedy
and vaudeville, all thought of drama, technically speaking, is abandoned
in watching the capers of the "merry-merry" or the outrageous "Dutch"
comedian wielding his deadly newspaper.</p>

<p>It is important for our immediate purposes to note: first, (as aforesaid),
that the amount of license allowed author and actor increases immeasurably
as we go down the scale; second, that the degree of familiarity with the
audience and cognizance of the spectator's existence varies inversely as
the degree of dramatic value. Thus, at one end of the scale we have, for
instance, Mrs. Fiske, whose fondness for playing to the centre of the
stage and ignoring the audience is commented upon as a mannerism; at the
other, the low comedian who says his say or sings his song directly at the
audience and converses gaily with them as his boon companions. Now it will
be shown that familiar address of the audience and the singing of monodies
to musical accompaniment are essential features of Plautus' style, and
many other implements of the lower types of modern drama are among his
favorite devices. If then we can place Plautus toward the bottom of the
scale, we relieve him vastly of responsibility as a dramatist and of the
necessity of adherence to verisimilitude. Where does he actually belong?
The answer must be sought in a detailed consideration of his methods of
producing his effects and in an endeavor to ascertain how far the audience
and the acting contributed to them.</p>



<h4>&sect;2. The Performance</h4>


<p>[Sidenote: The Audience] As it is perfectly patent that every practical
playwright must cater to his public, the audience is an essential feature
in our discussion. The audience of Plautus was not of a high class.
Terence, even in later times, when education had materially progressed,
often failed to reach them by over-finesse. Plautus with his bold brush
pleased them. Surely a turbulent and motley throng they were, with the
native violence of the sun-warmed Italic temperament and the abundant
animal spirits of a crude civilization, tumbling into the theatre in the
full enjoyment of holiday, scrambling for vantage points on the sloping
ground, if such were handy, or a good spot for their camp-stools. In view
of the uncertainty as to the actual site of the original performances,
this portraiture is "atmospheric" rather than "photographic." (See
Saunders in TAPA. XLIV, 1913). At any rate, we have ample evidence of the
turbulence of the early Roman audience. (Ter. Prol. <i>Hec.</i> 39-42, and
citations immediately following). Note the description of Mommsen:<sup><a href="#foot46">46</a></sup>
"The audience was anything but genteel.... The body of spectators cannot
have differed much from what one sees in the present day at public
fireworks and gratis exhibitions. Naturally, therefore, the proceedings
were not too orderly; children cried,<sup><a href="#foot47">47</a></sup> women talked and shrieked, now
and then a wench prepared to push her way to the stage; the ushers had on
these festivals anything but a holiday, and found frequent occasion to
confiscate a mantle or to ply the rod."<sup><a href="#foot48">48</a></sup></p>

<p>Impatient if the play be delayed, and voicing their disapproval by lusty
clapping, stamping, whistling and cat-calls, they are equally ready with
noisy approval if the dramatic fare tickle their palate.<sup><a href="#foot49">49</a></sup> The
<i>tibicen</i>, as he steps forth to render the overture, is greeted
uproariously as an old favorite. The manager perhaps appears and announces
the names of those taking part, each one of whom is doubtless applauded or
hissed in proportion to his measure of popularity. Differences of opinion
as to the merits of an individual actor may culminate in the partisans'
coming to blows.<sup><a href="#foot50">50</a></sup> Horace (<i>Ep.</i> II. I. 200 ff.) comments on the
turbulence of the audiences of his day too; while under the Empire
factions for and against particular actors grew up, as in the circus.<sup><a href="#foot51">51</a></sup>
Late-comers of course often disturbed the Prologus in his lines. The
continual reiteration that we find in such prologues as the <i>Amph.</i>,
<i>Cap.</i> and <i>Poen.</i> was naturally designed as a safeguard against such
disturbance. Yet these prologues were undoubtedly composed, as Ritschl has
shown (<i>Par.</i> 232 ff.), shortly after 146 B.C., and the turbulence of the
original audience must have been far greater.</p>

<p>To win the favor of such a crowd, which would groan if instead of the
expected comedy a tragedy should be announced,<sup><a href="#foot52">52</a></sup> what methods were
necessary? Slap-sticks, horse-play, broad slashing swashbuckling humor,
thick colors daubed on with lavish brush!</p>

<p>By Cicero's time the public had attained to such a degree of
sophistication that the slightest slip on the part of the wretched actor
was greeted by a storm of popular disapproval. "Histrio si paulum se movit
extra numerum, aut si versus pronuntiatus est syllaba una brevior aut
longior, exsibilatur, exploditur," says Cicero.<sup><a href="#foot53">53</a></sup> The actor dare not
even have a cold, for on the slightest manifestation of hoarseness, he was
hooted off, though favorites such as Roscius might be excused on the plea
of indisposition.<sup><a href="#foot54">54</a></sup> The Scholiast Cruquius to Hor. <i>Ser.</i> I. 10.37 ff.
notes: "Poemata ... in theatris exhibita imperitae multitudinis applausum
captare."</p>

<p>It is evident from all this that, while the Roman public had made
considerable advances in education, their demonstrative temperament had
not cooled. It seems eminently fair to deduce that the far ruder and less
cultivated audiences of Plautus' day were even more violent in their
manifestations of pleasure and displeasure, but that their criterion of
taste was solely the amount of amusement derived from the performance and
that they bothered themselves little about niceties of rhythm. To the
Roman, the scenic and histrionic were the vital features of a production.
Again we reiterate, only the bold brush could have pleased them.</p>

<p>That the plays of Plautus attained a permanent position in ihe theatrical
repertoire of Rome is of course well known; but he wrote primarily for his
own age, and in a difficult environment. Not only did he have to please a
highly volatile and inflammable public, but he must have been forced to
exercise tact to avoid offending the patrician powers, as the imprisonment
of Naevius indicates. Mommsen has an apt summary:<sup><a href="#foot55">55</a></sup> "Under such
circumstances, where art worked for daily wages and the artist instead of
receiving due honour was subjected to disgrace, the new national theatre
of the Romans could not present any development either original or even at
all artistic."</p>

<p>[Sidenote: The Actor] This brief discussion of the relation between public
and playwright will suffice for our purposes. In the course of it we have
insensibly encroached upon the next topic: the relation of public and
actor. Who after all is the chief factor in the success or failure of a
drama, in spite of the oft misquoted adage, "The play's the thing?" The
actor! The actor, who can mouth and tear a passion to tatters, or swing a
piece of trumpery into popular favor by the brute force of his dash and
personality. That this was true in Plautus' day, no less than in our own,
is plainly indicated by the personal allusion inserted in the <i>Bac.</i>
(214-5):</p>

<blockquote>  Etiam Epidicum, quam ego fabulam aeque ac me ipsum amo,<br />
Nullam aeque invitus specto, <i>si agit Pellio</i>.</blockquote>

<p>The servile status of the ancient actor is an index to the energy of his
performance, if to nothing else. Failure meant a beating, success a drink
at least.<sup><a href="#foot56">56</a></sup> Augustus humanely abrogated the whipping of actors, but an
attempt was made in Tiberius' time to renew the practice.<sup><a href="#foot57">57</a></sup> On the other
hand, there seem to have been prizes awarded to successful actors,<sup><a href="#foot58">58</a></sup> as
well as to the poet;<sup><a href="#foot59">59</a></sup> but this practice surely arose after Plautus'
lifetime. At any rate, whatever was the nature of the reward, in his day
the large emoluments won by Roscius and other popular favorites were
impossible.<sup><a href="#foot60">60</a></sup> The effort demanded by the elaborate education of the
actor,<sup><a href="#foot61">61</a></sup> in which naturally gesticulation was the most vital element,
was out of all proportion to the precarious reward. A rigid course of
training was prescribed and strenuous exercises were required, for both
actor and orator to keep the voice in proper form.<sup><a href="#foot62">62</a></sup> Indeed, Quintilian
advises the budding orator to take instruction in voice production and
gesticulation from the comic actor.<sup><a href="#foot63">63</a></sup> For the comic actor was at all
times recognized as livelier and more vivid in his performance than the
tragedian.<sup><a href="#foot64">64</a></sup> The two were usually sharply differentiated.<sup><a href="#foot65">65</a></sup>
Specialization arose, too, and we hear of actors who confined their
efforts to feminine roles,<sup><a href="#foot66">66</a></sup> though naturally every performer was cast
for parts to which his physique was best suited.<sup><a href="#foot67">67</a></sup></p>

<p>It is doubtful whether such an elaborate system had been developed in
Plautus' time, but this much is certain: the comedian was on the stage
lively, energetic and constantly spurred on by the fear of punishment from
the <i>dominus gregis</i> and the violent disapproval of a fickle, tempestuous
and withal exacting public. Polybius<sup><a href="#foot68">68</a></sup> relates that the visit of a
troupe of Greek actors to Rome was a failure because of their over-staid
deportment, until, learning the desires of the volatile Italians, they
improvised a vastly more vivid pantomime depicting a mock battle, with
huge success. Assuredly the early Roman comedian must have acted with
greater abandon and clownish drollery, if not with the elaborate
histrionic technique of the later actor.<sup><a href="#foot69">69</a></sup> We have heard Dr. Charles
Knapp relate that the performance of the <i>Ajax</i> of Sophocles by a troupe
of modern Greek players went with amazing and incredible rapidity and
vivacity. It is all of a piece. We must inevitably associate vivid
temperament with the sons of the Mediterranean in all ages. Yet we have
just seen that the Greeks of old were too self-contained for their Italian
brethren.</p>

<p>[Sidenote: The Histrionism] With this brief discussion of the condition,
incentive and motive of the Plautine actor, let us pass on to a more
detailed consideration of his methods and technique. Naturally by far the
most important part of this was gesture. Here again, while some of our
evidence is somewhat unreliable, practically every shred of extant
testimony indicates an extreme liveliness and vivacity. In the
rhetoricians frequent warning is issued to the forensic neophyte to avoid
the unrestraint of theatrical gesticulation. Cicero says (<i>De Or.</i> I. 59.
251): "Nemo suaserit studiosis dicendi adulescentibus in gestu discendo
histrionum more elaborare." Quintilian echoes (I. 11. 3): "Ne gestus quidem
omnis ac motus a comediis petendus est.... Orator plurimum ... aberit a
scaenico, nec vultu nec manu nec excursionibus nimius." And in the <i>Auctor
ad Herennium</i> we find (III. 15. 26): "Convenit igitur in vultu et pudorem
nec acrimoniam esse, in gestu et venustatem nec turpitudinem, ne aut
histriones aut operarii videamur esse."<sup><a href="#foot70">70</a></sup> That the nature and liveliness
of gesture on the stage was determined by the character portrayed, it is
almost needless to say.<sup><a href="#foot71">71</a></sup></p>

<p>Cicero's analysis (<i>de Or.</i> III. 59. 220) of the difference between
theatrical and forensic gesture implies that the former illustrates
individual words and ideas, while the latter comprehends more broadly the
general thought and sentiment.<sup><a href="#foot72">72</a></sup> It is most unfortunate that we have
lost Cicero's treatise <i>De Gestu Histrionis</i>.<sup><a href="#foot73">73</a></sup></p>

<p>By Cicero's time a more restrained mode of acting was evidently considered
good taste; witness <i>de Off.</i> (I. 36. 130): "Histrionum non nulli gestus
ineptus non vacant,    et quae sunt recta et simplicia laudantur."<sup><a href="#foot74">74</a></sup> But
the passages cited above bear ample testimony to the vigor of histrionic
gesticulation even at this later and far more cultivated epoch. Again we
repeat, what must have been the energy and abandon of the original
Plautine actor?<sup><a href="#foot75">75</a></sup></p>

<p>Apart from the rhetoricians, the most fruitful literary source of our
information on gesture is Donatus' commentary on Terence. The
trustworthiness of this has been the subject of much argument. Sittl<sup><a href="#foot76">76</a></sup>
accuses him of speaking merely from the standpoint of a professor of
rhetoric, as comedies of Terence were no longer given in the time of
Donatus. Weinberger in his "Beitrage zu den Buhnenaltherthumern aus Donats
Terenz-commentar,"<sup><a href="#foot77">77</a></sup> admonishes us to be very careful not to put too
high a value on the commentary. Van Wageningen<sup><a href="#foot78">78</a></sup> is of the opinion that
much of the work was inspired by Donatus' having seen in his own time
unmasked actors play. To this view color is lent by Donatus' note to
<i>And.</i> 716: "Sive haec &lt;Mysis&gt; personatis viris agitur, ut apud veteres,
sive per mulierem, ut nunc videmus."</p>

<p>If this is true, it makes Donatus' work of more significance to us, as it
would imply a harking back to the play of feature of the unmasked
performances of Plautus' day. But while it is certain that Donatus had
other sources than the Terentian text for his annotations,<sup><a href="#foot79">79</a></sup> it is
equally certain that practically everything he has to say relative to
gesture and stage business is readily to be deduced from the text and is
in the main interesting only as a compilation.<sup><a href="#foot80">80</a></sup> However, everything he
says continues to point persistently to lively gesture and action; and
this too in Terentian comedy, where the text makes far less rigorous
demands on the actor's muscles than in Plautus' works.</p>

<p>Donatus remarks occasionally that certain words must have been accompanied
by especially expressive gesture and byplay, evidently of feature, as
<i>vultuose, cum gestu</i> and similar phrases are used to indicate this.<sup><a href="#foot81">81</a></sup>
His note to <i>And.</i> 722 is: "Haec scaena actuosa est: magis enim in gestu
quam in oratione est constituta." Of gestures emphatic and yet not foreign
to everyday life Quintilian notes (XI. 3. 123): "Femur ferire--et usitatum
et indignantis decet"; a movement plainly employed in <i>Mil.</i> 204 and
<i>Truc.</i> 601. But, says Quintilian further (ib.): "Complodere manus
scaenicum est et pectus caedere."<sup><a href="#foot82">82</a></sup></p>

<p>One of the notable "hits" of the ancient stage is recorded by Donatus ad
<i>Phor.</i> 315: Ambivius (as Phormio) entered "oscitans temulenter atque
aurem minimo scalpens digitulo ... et labia lingens ut ebrius et ructans."
But Ambivius' potations resulted in an extremely spirited and lifelike
imitation of the parasite character and he was forthwith forgiven his
drunkenness.</p>

<p>Passing mention must be made of the Terentian Mss. illustrations, though
they add but little weight to the foregoing. For a complete list of their
sources and editions see Sittl, "Geb&auml;rden der Griechen und R&ouml;mer," Chap.
XI, p. 203 ff.<sup><a href="#foot83">83</a></sup> But whatever be the exact date of the original, in our
extant copies the old traditional gestures are lost and the gesture of
everyday life supplied. In fact, in the analyses appended by Leo, van
Wageningen and Warnecke, in the works cited above, we arrive at little but
that the gestures natural to any Italian-born person in a like situation
are reproduced, such as "gestus abeuntis, cogitantis, parasiti," etc. It
is almost too much to make any of this a basis for argument as to
classical and pre-classical stage-craft. It is at least significant that
every character with hands free is gesticulating and the scene from <i>Eun.</i>
IV. 6-7 is evidently full of vigorous action.</p>

<p>An old and discursive article<sup><a href="#foot84">84</a></sup> by T. Baden, containing a description
and analysis of the gestures and posture of a number of familiar figures
from comedy exemplified in some collections of statuettes (chiefly those
in Borgia's Museum of Baden's time), is open to the same objection as the
above. The gestures of slave, pander, parasite, etc., described in the
article are lively and expressive to be sure, but contain little to
differentiate them from those of daily life.</p>

<p>While much of our evidence is still to come, we believe that we are
already justified in the deduction that the actor contemporary with
Plautus must have indulged in the extravagances of the players in the
Atellan farces and the mimes. The <i>mimus</i> of the Empire, we know,
specialized in ridiculous facial contortions.<sup><a href="#foot85">85</a></sup></p>

<p>We must not forget too the vivacity indicated by the comic scenes among
the Pompeian and Herculanean wall-paintings,<sup><a href="#foot86">86</a></sup> which have a close
kinship with the Terentian MSS. pictures. Nor must we lose sight of the
fact that all our pictorial <i>reliquiae</i> portray the later masked
characters, and hence play of feature, which must have been a notable
concomitant of the original Plautine performance, is entirely obscured.</p>

<p>As our intention is fundamentally to get at the original intent of our
poet and his actors, a discussion of the mask is not in order. Whether we
agree with Donatus' statement that masks were first introduced for comedy
and tragedy by Cincius Faliscus and Minucius Prothymus respectively,<sup><a href="#foot87">87</a></sup>
or with Diomedes' explanation<sup><a href="#foot88">88</a></sup> that Roscius adopted them to disguise
his pronounced squint, it is certain that they were not worn in Plautus'
time, when wigs and make-up were employed for characterization.<sup><a href="#foot89">89</a></sup> In
fact, the early performances of Plautus, unless we except the original
Terentian productions, stand almost alone in the history of Graeco-Roman
comedy as unmasked plays. This would give opportunity for the practice of
lively grimace and facial play.</p>

<p>The text itself contains not infrequent descriptions of the outward
appearance of the characters, often pointing to grotesqueries of make-up
that rival those of the Old Comedy. From <i>As.</i> 400-1 we learn that Saurea
was:</p>

<blockquote>  Macilentis malis, rufulus, aliquantum ventriosus,<br />
Truculentis oculis, commoda statura, tristi fronte.</blockquote>

<p>In the <i>Mer.</i> Lysimachus is described as a veritable <i>thensaurus
mali</i> (639-40):</p>

<blockquote>  Canum, varum, ventriosum, buculentum, breviculum,<br />
Subnigris oculis, oblongis malis, pansam aliquantulum.</blockquote>

<p>Curculio was one-eyed: "Unocule, salve" (Cur. 392). Pseudolus must have
been a joy to the groundlings <i>(Ps.</i> 1218 ff.):</p>

<blockquote>  Rufus quidam, ventriosus, crassis suris, subniger,<br />
Magno capite, acutis oculis, ore rubicundo, admodum<br />
Magnis pedibus. BA. Perdidisti, ut nominavisti pedes.<br />
Pseudolus fuit ipsus.</blockquote>

<p>His red slave's wig is thus made a feature in the characterization.
(Cf. Ter. <i>Phor.</i> 51). When Trachalio is looking for the procurer,
he inquires (<i>Rud.</i> 316 ff.):</p>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                                    Ecquem<br />
Recalvom ad Silanum senem, statutum, ventriosum,<br />
Tortis superciliis, contracta fronte...?<sup><a href="#foot90">90</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>The precise details of the histrionic technique and "stage business" in
vogue must remain more or less a mystery to us. Our limitations in this
respect are admirably enunciated by Saunders (TAPA. XLIV, p. 97): "One
must conclude then, that it is dangerous to dogmatize on this subject, as
on most others connected with the early Roman stage. Our evidence is too
slight and the period of time involved is too long...." We can, therefore,
deal in little but generalities. The Romans must have imitated and
developed their Greek and Etruscan models.<sup><a href="#foot91">91</a></sup> When Livius Andronicus
first fathered <i>palliatae</i>, he must have chosen the New Comedy not only as
the type of drama most available to him, but as wholly adaptable to his
audiences. When Plautus wrote, he had the machinery already built for him,
and he doubtless seized upon the <i>palliata</i> form as the natural medium for
the exploitation of his talents. By Cicero's time considerable technical
equipment was required; the actor must be an adept in gesticulation,
gymnastic and dancing.<sup><a href="#foot92">92</a></sup> Appreciable refinement had been reached in
Quintilian's age, for he scores the comic actor who departs too far from
reality and pronounces the ideal player him who declaims with a measured
artistic heightening of everyday discourse.<sup><a href="#foot93">93</a></sup> It is noteworthy that this
practically coincides with the accepted standard of modern realistic
acting. But the Plautine actor could never have felt himself trammeled by
any such narrow and sophisticated restrictions, as we believe the evidence
accumulated above amply proves. At any rate, the delineation of different
roles must have been at all times strictly in character. The need of
feminine vocal tones, unless another jest is intended is indicated by
<i>Rud.</i> 233:</p>

<blockquote>  Certe vox muliebris auris tetigit meas.</blockquote>

<p>And Quintilian admonishes the youth who is taking lessons from a comic
actor in voice-production not to carry his precepts so far as to imitate
the female falsetto, the senile tremolo, the obsequiousness of the slave,
the stuttering accents of intoxication or the intonations of love, greed,
fear.<sup><a href="#foot94">94</a></sup></p>

<p>Where Donatus gives instructions as to the vocal expression with which
certain lines are to be delivered, as in the case of his comments on
gesture, they are almost painfully evident from the context. He cites for
instance irony<sup><a href="#foot95">95</a></sup>, anger<sup><a href="#foot96">96</a></sup>, exhaustion <sup><a href="#foot97">97</a></sup>, amazement <sup><a href="#foot98">98</a></sup>,
sympathy<sup><a href="#foot99">99</a></sup>, pity<sup><a href="#foot100">100</a></sup>. He appears as the lineal ancestor of the modern
"coach" of amateur theatricals in somewhat naively remarking<sup><a href="#foot101">101</a></sup> that
upon leaving Thais for two days, Phaedria must pronounce "two days" as if
"two years" were written.</p>

<p>Another phase of the delivery of the dialogue that deserves passing
mention is song and musical accompaniment. Livy's anecdote<sup><a href="#foot102">102</a></sup> of the
employment by Livius Andronicus of a boy to sing for him while he
gesticulated is almost universally accepted as an exceptional instance,
prompted by the failing of Livius' voice through age<sup><a href="#foot103">103</a></sup>. We are now
fairly well informed of the tripartite diversion of the dialogue into
<i>canticum</i> or song proper, recitative, and <i>diverbium</i> or spoken
utterance<sup><a href="#foot104">104</a></sup>, with the incidental accompaniment of the <i>tibia</i>. Though
there may be some dispute as to the apportionment of the various classes,
the general truth is established.<sup><a href="#foot105">105</a></sup> The important feature of this for
our purpose is that, if the ancient tragedy with its music and dancing was
rather comparable to modern grand opera than to drama proper, the song and
musical accompaniment of comedy lend it a strong flavor of the opera
bouffe and even of the musical comedy of to-day. In Part II we shall draw
numerous other parallels between this style of composition and the plays
of Plautus. West, in A.J.P. VIII. 33, notes one of the few comparisons to
"comic opera" that we have seen. Fay, in the Introduction to his ed. of
the <i>Most.</i> (&sect; 11), likens Plautine drama to "an opera of the early
schools."</p>

<p>One feature of the performance still remains to be discussed--the
"stage-business," that is, the movements of the actors apart from mere
gesticulation and dialogue. Much of this too will find a place in Part II,
in the treatment of special peculiarities, but in general we note here
that the text itself contains many indications that are as plain as
printed stage directions regarding the movements being made or about to be
made by the characters. Examples of the more significant follow: <i>Amph.</i>
308: Cingitur: Certe expedit se; 312: Perii, pugnos ponderat. (Sosia
speaks aside of Mercury and similarly during the succeeding scene); 903:
Potin ut abstineas manum?; 955: Aperiuntur aedis. This motif is
commonplace and frequent; 958: Vos tranquillos video; 1130: quam valide
tonuit; <i>As.</i> 39: Age, age, usque excrea; <i>Bac.</i> 668: quod sic terram
optuere?; <i>Cap.</i> 557: Viden tu hunc, quam inimico voltu intuitur?; 594:
Ardent oculi;<sup><a href="#foot106">106</a></sup> 793: Hic homo pugilatum incipit; <i>Ep.</i> 609: illi
caperrat frons severitudine; <i>Mer.</i> 138: iam dudum spato sanguinem; <i>Mil.</i>
1324: Nefle; <i>Most.</i> 1030: vocis non habeo satis. (He must have been
shouting); <i>Ps.</i> 458: Statum vide hominis, Callipho, quam basilicum; 955:
transvorsus ... cedit, quasi cancer solet: <i>Trin.</i> 623 f.: celeri
graducunt uterque: ille rcprehendit hunc priorem pallio.<sup><a href="#foot107">107</a></sup></p>

<p>This practice of indicating business in the lines, of making the
play act, is common to all the older types of drama, Elizabethan as
well as classic. A single striking example from Shakespeare will
furnish a parallel, in the well-known lines from <i>Macbeth</i>:</p>

<blockquote>  The devil damn thee black, thou cream-faced loon,<br />
Where gott'st thou that goose look? (V. 3).</blockquote>

<p>The modern playwright robs his lines of their vividness and
throws the onus on the actor through the medium of his interpolated
direction, a custom which reaches its most exaggerated form
in the plays of Bernard Shaw, as mentioned above.</p>

<p>[Sidenote: Thesis] We have now made a perceptible advance towards getting
an answer to our original questions: "What manner of drama is this?" and
"How was it done?" The comments of the most eminent critics on the former
question have left us rather bewildered by their diversity. Almost to a
man they have taken Plautus too seriously or else have arraigned him for
not conforming to their preconceived code of comedy, without questioning
whether it were Plautus' own or not. This has really nullified their
efforts to explain away the peculiarities and absurdities of his style.
Some <i>solvent</i> of these difficulties is needed.</p>

<p>As to the second question, we have examined briefly the extant evidence
regarding the actor's employment of gesture and business, his delivery of
the dialogue, make-up and character delineation, and found a disappointing
paucity, but a general and irresistible trend towards liveliness, vivacity
and broad undiluted comedy that must have been the sort of dramatic fare
demanded by the primeval appetite of the Plautine audience. But again we
find ourselves falling short of a satisfying answer to our question.
Again, some <i>solvent</i> is needed. As the last resort, we turn to the
evidence of the plays themselves and the unbounded realm of subjective
criticism.</p>

<p>From the earliest times gesture and business in Aristophanes and the Old
Comedy were marked by the riotous license of all the media of that notable
epoch<sup><a href="#foot108">108</a></sup> of comedy. From the broad spirit of its frank and vivid
burlesque not even the most stolidly Teutonic of humorless critics ever
thought of demanding a "picture of life." But with the abandonment of the
purpose of political propaganda, the consequent disappearance of the
chorus with its burlesque trappings (largely through motives of state
economy), and the establishment in the New Comedy of a type of dramatic
machinery that had a specious outer shell of reflection of characters and
events in daily life, the critics instantly seem to demand the standard of
dramatic technique of Aristotle and Freytag and condemn all departures
from this standard. In reality, we believe that the kinship of Plautus
with Aristophanes is much closer than has usually been realized.</p>

<p>Is, then, the change from Old to New Comedy as great as has been
represented? Does not the change consist rather in the outer form and in
the ideas expounded than in the spirit of the histrionism and mimicry? And
must not the vigor, from what we have seen, have been intensified in
Plautus? LeGrand alone seems to have caught the essence of this:<sup><a href="#foot109">109</a></sup> "Que
dire de la mimique? D'apr&egrave;s les indications contenues dans le texte m&ecirc;me
des com&eacute;dies, d'apr&egrave;s les commentaires--notamment ceux de Donat, d'apr&egrave;s
les monuments figur&eacute;s--en particulier les images des manuscrits, elle
devait &ecirc;tre en general tr&egrave;s vive, souvent trop vive pour le go&ucirc;t des
modernes.... Et puis, ils s'addressaient a des spectateurs m&eacute;ridionaux,
coutumiers dans la vie quotidienne d'une gesticulation plus anim&eacute;e que la
n&ocirc;tre." And this is said as a combined estimate of New Comedy and
<i>palliatae</i>.</p>

<p>We are now prepared to advance a definite thesis, that shall gather up the
random threads of argument and suggestion scattered through the foregoing
pages and shall, we hope, provide a conclusive and final answer to both of
our original questions. If we can establish: that our author's sole aim
was to feed the popular hunger for amusement; that, while after leaving
much of his Greek originals practically untouched, he considered them in
effect but a medium for the provocation of laughter, but a vessel into
which to pour a highly seasoned brew of fun; that to this end his actors
went before the public, potentially speaking slap-stick in hand, equipped
by nature with liveliness of grimace and gesture and prepared to act with
verve, unction and an abandon of dash and vigor that would produce a riot
of merriment; that his dramatic machinery is hopelessly crippled and that
his evident intentions and effects are hopelessly lost unless interpreted
in this spirit: then we relegate Plautine drama to a low plane of broad
farce, where verisimilitude to life becomes wholly unnecessary because
undesirable; where the canons of dramatic art become inoperative; where,
contrary to what K&ouml;rting says, we are not asked to believe that
"everything is happening in a perfectly natural manner"; where the poet
may stick at nothing provided the laugh be forthcoming; where all the
apparently absurd conventions of <i>palliatae</i> cease to be absurd, vanish
into thin air and become unamenable to literary criticism, inasmuch as
they are all only part of the laugh-compelling scheme. This is the
<i>solvent</i> that we propose. To establish this, let us proceed to an
examination of the internal mechanism of the plays.</p>




<h2>Part II</h2>

<h3>An Analysis of the Dramatic Values in Plautus</h3>



<p>The salient features that characterize the plays of Plautus include both
his consciously employed means of producing his comic effects, and the
peculiarities and abnormalities that evidence his attitude of mind in
writing them. We should make bold to catalogue them as follows:</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman">
  <li>Machinery characteristic of the lower types of modern drama--farce, low
   comedy, musical comedy, burlesque shows, vaudeville, and the like.
    <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">
      <li>Devices self-evident from the text.
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
          <li>Bombast and mock-heroics.</li>
          <li>Horse-play and slap-sticks.</li>
          <li>Burlesque, farce and extravagance of situation and dialogue.
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
              <li>True burlesque.</li>
              <li>True farce.</li>
              <li>Extravagances obviously unnatural and merely for the sake of fun.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Devices absurd and inexplicable unless interpreted in a broad
     farcical spirit.
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
          <li>The running slave.</li>
          <li>Wilful blindness.</li>
         <li>Adventitious entrance.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>

<li>Evidences of loose composition which prove a disregard of
    technique and hence indicate that entertainment was the sole aim.
  <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">
   <li> Solo speeches and passages.
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
      <li>Asides and soliloquies.</li>
      <li>Lengthy monodies, monologues and episodical specialties. </li>
      <li>Direct address of the audience.</li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li>Inconsistencies and carelessness of composition.
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
      <li>Pointless badinage and padded scenes. </li>
      <li>Inconsistencies of character and situation. </li>
      <li>Looseness of dramatic construction. </li>
      <li>Roman admixture and topical allusions. </li>
      <li>Jokes on the dramatic machinery. </li>
      <li>Use of stock plots and characters.</li>
    </ol>
   </li>
  </ol>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Let us illustrate these points by typical passages and endeavor to insert
such stage-directions as would indicate how the most telling effects could
be produced and hence aid the reader in visualizing the actual
performance.</p>


<h3>I. Machinery Characteristic of the Lower Types of Modern Drama</h3>

<h4>A. <i>Devices self-evident from the text.</i></h4>

<p align="center"><b>1. Bombast and mock-heroics.</b></p>

<p>It is a little difficult to sublimate this entirely from burlesque, but
its true nature is instanced by the opening lines of the <i>Miles</i>, where
the vainglorious Pyrgopolinices, with many a sweep and strut, addresses
his attendants, who are probably staggering under the weight of an
enormous shield:</p>

<p>"Have a care that the effulgence of my shield be brighter than e'er the
sun's rays in a cloudless sky: when the time for action comes and the
battle's on, I intend it shall dazzle the eyesight o' m' foes. (<i>Patting
his sword</i>). Verily I would condole with this m' sword, lest he lament and
be cast down in spirit, forasmuch as now full long hath he hung idle by m'
side, thirsting, poor lad, to meet his fellow 'mongst the foe," and so on.</p>

<p>In line with this, a simulation of the military is a favorite device. So
we find Pseudolus addressing the audience in ringing blustering tones and
with grandiose gesture (<i>Ps.</i> 584 ff.):</p>

<p>"It now becomes my aim today to lay siege to this town and capture it."
(Ballio the procurer is the town). "I shall hurl all my legions against
it. If I take it, ... good luck to you, my citizens, for part of the booty
shall be yours."</p>

<p>This finds a close counterpart in the <i>Mil.</i> 219 ff., a passage which
West<sup><a href="#foot110">110</a></sup> thinks was deliberately inserted to rouse the populace into
demanding that Scipio be at once despatched to Africa.</p>

<p>Periplecomenus is urging Palaestrio to find a stratagem. Actually he
probably addresses the pit:</p>

<p>"Don't you see that the enemy are upon you and investing your rear? Call a
council of war, reach out for stores and reinforcements in this crisis:
haste, haste, no time to waste! Make a detour through some pass, forestall
your foes, beleaguer them, protect our troops! Cut off the enemy's base of
supplies!" etc.</p>

<p>Whether this passage had an ulterior purpose or not, the motif is
frequent.<sup><a href="#foot111">111</a></sup> So we find Chrysalus in <i>Bac.</i> 925 ff. holding the stage
for an entire scene with an elaborate comparison of himself to Ulysses,
the brains of the Greek host, overcoming his master Nicobulus who
represents Priam.</p>

<p>In general the mocking assumption of an heroic attitude recurs with
sufficient frequency to stamp it as a staple of comic effect. Many
passages would become tiresome and meaningless instead of amusing unless
so interpreted. The soliloquy of Mnesilochus in <i>Bac.</i> 500 ff. could be
made interesting only by turgid ranting. Similarly in <i>Bac.</i> 530 ff. and
612 ff.<sup><a href="#foot112">112</a></sup></p>


<p align="center"><b>2. Horse-play and slap-sticks.</b></p>

<p>By this we mean what can in nowise be so clearly defined as by
"rough-house." For instance, the turbulent Euclio in <i>Aul.</i> delivers
bastings impartially to various <i>dramatis personae</i> and as a climax drives
the cooks and music-girl pell-mell out of the house, doubtless accompanied
by deafening howling and clatter (415 ff.). Similarly in the <i>Cas.</i> (875
ff.) Chalinus routs Olympio and the lecherous Lysidamus. We may well
imagine that such scenes were preceded as well as accompanied by a fearful
racket within (a familiar device of our low comedy and extravaganza), the
effect probably heightened by tempestuous <i>melodrama</i> on the <i>tibiae</i>, as
both the scenes cited are in <i>canticum</i>.</p>

<p>In the <i>Men.</i> we are treated to a free fight, in which the valiant
Messenio routs the <i>lorarii</i> by vigorous punches, while Menaechmus plants
his fist in one antagonist's eye (<i>Men.</i> 1011 ff.):</p>

<p>(Menaechmus of Epidamnus is seized by <i>lorarii</i>; as he struggles,
Messenio, slave of Menaechmus Sosicles, rushes into the fray to his
rescue). "MES. I say! Gouge out that fellow's eye, the one that's got you
by the shoulder, master. Now as for these rotters, I'll plant a crop of
fists on their faces. (<i>Lays about.</i>) By Heaven, you'll be everlastingly
sorry for the day you tried to carry my master off. Let go!</p>

<p>MEN. (<i>Joining in with a will.</i>) I've got this fellow by the eye!</p>

<p>MES. Bore it out! A hole's good enough for his face! You villians, you
thieves, you robbers! (<i>General mel&eacute;e. Lorarii weaken.</i>)</p>

<p>LOR. We're done for! Oh Lord, please!</p>

<p>MES. Let go then!</p>

<p>MEN. What right had you to lay hands on me? Give them a good beating up!
(<i>Lorarii break and scatter wildly under the ferocious onslaught.</i>)</p>

<p>MES. Come, clear out! To the devil with you all! That for <i>you</i>!
(<i>Strikes.</i>) You're the last; here's <i>your</i> reward! (<i>Strikes again.</i>)"</p>

<p>The lines themselves are sufficiently graphic and need but little
annotation. Other pugilistic activities crop up at not infrequent
intervals in the text,<sup><a href="#foot113">113</a></sup> and in <i>Ps.</i> 135 ff. Ballio generously plies
the whip. In the lacuna of the <i>Amph.</i> after line 1034, Mercury probably
bestows a drenching on Amphitruo.<sup><a href="#foot114">114</a></sup> In <i>As.</i> III. 3, especially 697
ff., Libanus makes his master Argyrippus "play horsey" with him, doubtless
with indelicate buffonery. With invariable energy, even so simple a matter
as knocking on doors is made the excuse for raising a violent disturbance,
as in <i>Amph.</i> 1019 f. and 1025: Paene effregisti, fatue, foribus
cardines.<sup><a href="#foot115">115</a></sup> And this idea is actually parodied in <i>As.</i> 384 ff. No,
Plautus did not allow his public to languish for want of noise.</p>


<p align="center"><b>3. Burlesque, farce and extravagance of situation and dialogue.</b></p>

<p>Under this head we include such conscious strivings for comic as are
frankly and plainly exaggerated and hyper-natural.</p>

<p align="center">
a. True burlesque.</p>

<p>This is in effect pure parody, cartooning. Patent burlesque of tragedy
appears in <i>Trin.</i> 820 ff. (<i>Charmides returns from abroad.</i>)</p>

<p>"CHAR. To Neptune, ruler of the deep, and puissant brother unto Jove and
Nereus, do I in joy and gladness cry my praises and gratefully proclaim my
gratitude; and to the briny waves, who held me in their power, yea, even
my chattels and my very life, and from their realms restored me to the
city of my birth," etc., etc.</p>

<p>To tickle the ears of the groundlings, this must have been delivered in
grandiloquent mimicry with all the paraphernalia of the tragic style.
Horace notes a kindred manifestation of this tendency (to which he himself
is pleasingly addicted), in <i>Ep.</i> II. 3.93 f.:</p>

<blockquote>  Interdum tamen et vocem comoedia tollit<br />
Iratusque Chremes tumido delitigat ore.</blockquote>

<p>Tragic burlesque is again beautifully exemplified in <i>Ps.</i> 702 ff. The
versatile Pseudolus after a significant aside: "I'll address the fellow in
high-sounding words," says to his master Calidorus:</p>

<p>"Hail! Hail! Thee, thee, O mighty ruler, thee do I beseech who art lord
over Pseudolus. Thee do I seek that thou mayst obtain thrice three times
triple delights in three various ways, joys earned by three tricks and
three tricksters, cunningly won by treachery, fraud and villainy, which in
this little sealed missive have I but erstwhile brought to thee....</p>

<p>CHAR. The rascal's spouting like a tragedian."</p>

<p>When Sosia, in the first scene of <i>Amph.</i> (203 ff.), turgidly describes
the battle between the Thebans and Teleboans, he is parodying the
Messenger of tragedy. Another echo from tragedy is heard at the end of the
play, when Jupiter appears in the role of deus ex machina.<sup><a href="#foot116">116</a></sup></p>

<p>Burlesque of character and calling puts in an occasional appearance. The
recreant Sosia in <i>Amph.</i> 958 ff. mimics the dutiful slave. <i>As.</i> 259 ff.
contains an ironical treatment of augury, while in 751 ff. the poet has
his satirical fling at the legal profession.</p>


<p align="center">b. True farce.</p>

<p>This is of course the comedy of situation and finds its mainstay in
mistaken identity. The <i>Men.</i> and <i>Amph.</i> with their doubles are
farce-comedies proper, but the element of farce forms the motive power of
nearly all the plots; for example, the shuffling-up of Acropolistis,
Telestis and the <i>fidicina</i> in <i>Ep.</i>, the quarrel between Mnesilochus and
Pistoclerus in <i>Bac.</i> resulting from the former's belief that his friend
had stolen his sweetheart, the exchange of names between Tyndarus and
Philocrates in <i>Cap.</i>, the entrapping of Demaenetus with the <i>meretrix</i> at
the d&eacute;nouement of <i>As.</i>, etc., etc. It is understood, we presume, that the
modern farce occupies no exalted position in the comic scale, is
distinguished by the grotesquerie of its characters, incidents and
dialogue, and is indulgently permitted to stray far from the paths of
realism. Even in Shakespearian farce, note the exaggerated antics of the
two Dromios in "The Comedy of Errors." It is significant then that farce
is a staple of our plays.</p>

<p>The farcical element is strikingly exemplified in <i>Amph.</i> 365-462, where
Mercury persuades Sosia that he is not himself. Impersonation and
assumption of a role is another noteworthy and frequent medium of plot
motivation. In <i>As.</i> 407 ff. Leonida tries to palm himself off as the
<i>atriensis</i>. Note the violent efforts of the two slaves to wheedle the
cunning ass-dealer (449 ff.). In <i>Cas.</i> 815 ff. Chalinus enters disguised
as the blushing bride. In <i>Men.</i> 828 ff. Menaechmus Sosicles pretends
madness in a clever scene of uproarious humor. In the <i>Mil.</i> (411 ff.)
Philocomasium needs only to change clothing to appear in the role of her
own hypothetical twin sister, and in 874 ff. and 1216 ff. the <i>meretrix</i>
plays <i>matrona</i>. Sagaristio and the daughter of the <i>leno</i> impersonate
Persians (<i>Per.</i> 549 ff.), Collabiscus becomes a Spartan (<i>Poen.</i> 578
ff.), Simia as Harpax gets Ballio's money (<i>Ps.</i> 905 ff.), the sycophant
is garbed as messenger (<i>Trin.</i> 843 ff.), Phronesium elaborately pretends
to be a mother (<i>Truc.</i> 499 ff.). A swindle is almost invariably the
object in view. But we have said enough on this score: no one who knows
the plays at all can fail to recognize the predominance of farce. Compare
on the modern stage the sudden appearance of "the long-lost cousin from
Chicago."</p>


<p align="center">c. Extravagances obviously unnatural and merely for the sake of fun.</p>

<p>This group of course often contains marked features of burlesque and
farce, and hence shows a close kinship with the foregoing.</p>

<p>The extravagance of the love-sick swain is a fruitful source of this
species of caricature. The ridiculous Calidorus, always wearing his heart
on his sleeve, rolls his eyes, brushes away a tear and says (<i>Ps.</i> 38
ff.): "But for a short space have I been e'en as a lily of the field.
Suddenly sprang I up, as suddenly I withered." The irreverent Pseudolus
replies: "Oh, shut up while I read the letter over." Calidorus finds his
counterpart in Phaedromus of the <i>Cur.</i>, who, accompanied by his slave,
approaches milady's abode (<i>Cur.</i> 10 ff.):</p>

<p>"PH. (<i>In languishing accents, with eyes cast upward</i>): Shall I not take
sweets to the sweet: what is culled by the toil of the busy bees to my own
little honey?... (<i>They advance to milady's doorway which he sprinkles
with wine</i>, 88 ff.): Come, drink, ye portals of pleasure, quaff and deign
to be propitious unto me.</p>

<p>PALINURUS SER. (<i>Addressing the door with mimicry of Phaedromus' airs.</i>)
Do you want some olives or sweetmeats or capers?</p>

<p>PH. (<i>Continuing.</i>) Arouse your portress; hither send her unto me.
(<i>Lavishes the wine.</i>)</p>

<p>PAL. (<i>In great alarm, grasping his arm.</i>) You're spilling the wine!
What's got hold of you?</p>

<p>PH. Unhand me! (<i>Gently shakes himself loose.</i>) Lo! The temple of joys
untold is opening. Did not the hinge creak? 'Tis charming!</p>

<p>PAL. (<i>Turning aside in disgust.</i>) Why don't you give it a kiss?"</p>

<p>In each case the impertinent slave provides the foil. When the lovers
succeed in meeting, they are interlocked in embrace from 172 to 192,
probably invested with no small amount of suggestive "business." This
would doubtless hardly be tolerated by the "censor" today. Another variety
of lover's extravagance is the lavishing of terms of endearment, as we
find in <i>Cas.</i> 134 ff.<sup><a href="#foot117">117</a></sup></p>

<p>When this feature of "extravagance" enters the situation instead of the
dialogue, we have episodes such as the final scene of the <i>Ps.</i>, where the
name character is irrelevantly introduced (1246) in a state of
intoxication which, with copious belching in Simo's face, culminates in a
rebellion of the overloaded stomach (1294). We can scarcely doubt that
such business was carried out in ultra-graphic detail and rewarded by
copious guffaws from the populace. In sharp contrast to this, the
drunkenness of Callidamates in <i>Most.</i> 313 ff. is depicted with unusual
artistry, but still from the very nature of such a scene it may be labeled
"extravagant."</p>

<p>Manifestation of violent anger is another source of exaggerated stage
business. <i>Ep.</i> 512 ff. should be interpreted somewhat as follows:</p>

<p>"(<i>The deluded Periphanes has just discovered that the fidicina is an
impostor and not his daughter.</i>) FID. (<i>Sweetly.</i>) Do you want me for
anything else?</p>

<p>PER. (<i>Stamping foot and shaking fists in a passion.</i>) The foul fiend take
you to utter perdition! Clear out, and quickly too!</p>

<p>FID. (<i>In alarm.</i>) Won't you give me back my harp?</p>

<p>PER. Nor harp nor pipes! So hurry up and get out of here, if you know
what's good for you!</p>

<p>FID. (<i>Stamping her foot in tearful rage.</i>) I'll go, but you'll have to
give them back later just the same and it will be all the worse for you.</p>

<p>PER. (<i>Striding up and down in wildest anger.</i>) What!... shall I let her
go unpunished? Nay, even if I have to lose as much again, I'll lose it
rather than let myself be mocked and despoiled with impunity!" and so
on.<sup><a href="#foot118">118</a></sup></p>

<p>Other random scenes that may be classed as "extravagant" are found in
Strobilus' cartoon of Euclio (<i>Aul.</i> 300 ff.), Demipho's discovery in the
distance of a mythical bidder for the girl (<i>Mer.</i> 434 ff.), Charinus'
playing "horsey" and taking a trip in his imaginary car (<i>Mer.</i> 930 ff.),
and the loud "boo-hoo" to which Philocomasium gives vent (<i>Mil.</i> 1321
ff.). These all might be classed under either "farce" or "burlesque," but
they seem to come more exactly under the kindred head of "extravagance."</p>

<p>A familiar figure in modern farce-comedy is the comic conspirator with
finger on lip, tiptoeing round in fear of listeners. He finds his
prototype in <i>Trin.</i> (146 ff.):</p>

<p>"(<i>Callicles and Megaronides converse.</i>)</p>

<p>CAL. (<i>In a mysterious whisper.</i>) Look around a bit and make sure there's
nobody spying on us--and please look around every few seconds. (<i>They
pause and peer in every direction, perhaps creeping round on tiptoe.</i>)</p>

<p>MEG. Now, I am all ears.</p>

<p>CAL. When you're through, I'll talk. (<i>Pauses and nods.</i>) Just before
Charmides went abroad, he showed me a treasure, (<i>stops and looks over his
shoulders</i>) in his house here, in one of the rooms. (<i>Starts, as if at a
noise.</i>) Look around! (<i>They repeat the search and return again.</i>)</p>

<p>MEG. There's nobody."<sup><a href="#foot119">119</a></sup></p>

<p>Another old stage friend is the detected plotter trying to lie out of an
embarrassing situation. He is lineally descended from Tranio in the
<i>Most.</i> Tranio has just induced his master Theopropides to pay forty minae
to the money-lender on the pretext that Theopropides' son Philolaches has
bought a house (659 ff.):</p>

<p>"TH. In what neighborhood did my son buy this house?</p>

<p>TR. (<i>Aside to audience in comic despair, with appropriate gesture.</i>) See
there now! I'm a goner!</p>

<p>TH. (<i>Impatiently.</i>) Will you answer my question?</p>

<p>TR. Oh yes, but (<i>Stammering and displaying symptoms of acute
embarrassment</i>) I--I'm trying to think of the owner's name. (<i>Groans.</i>)</p>

<p>TH. Well, hurry up and remember it!</p>

<p>TR. (<i>Rapidly, aside.</i>) I can't see anything better to do than tell him
his son bought the house of our next-door neighbor here. (<i>With a shrug.</i>)
Thunder, I've heard that a <i>steaming</i> lie is the best kind.
(<i>Mock-heroically.</i>) 'Tis the will of the gods, my mind's made up.</p>

<p>TH. (<i>Who has been frowning and stamping in impatience.</i>) Well, well,
well! Haven't you thought of it yet?</p>

<p>TR. (<i>Aside.</i>) Curses on him!... (<i>Finally turning and bursting out
suddenly.</i>) It's our next-door neighbor here--your son bought the house
from him. (<i>He sees that the lie goes and sighs with relief.</i>)"<sup><a href="#foot120">120</a></sup></p>

<p>Another variation on this theme is the futile effort of the plotter to get
rid of a character armed with incriminating evidence. Again we quote
<i>Most.</i> (573 ff.), where Tranio is conversing with Theopropides. The
money-lender from whom young Philolaches has borrowed appears on the other
side of the stage. Tranio espies him. He must keep him away from the old
man. With a hurried excuse he flies across to meet Misargyrides.</p>

<p>"TR. (<i>Taking Misargyrides' arm and attempting to steer him off-stage.</i>) I
was never so glad to see a man in my life.</p>

<p>MIS. (<i>Suspiciously, holding back.</i>) What's the matter?</p>

<p>TR. (<i>Confidentially.</i>) Just step this way. (<i>Looks back apprehensively at
Theopropides, who is regarding them suspiciously.</i>)</p>

<p>MIS. (<i>In a loud and offensive voice.</i>) Won't my interest be paid?</p>

<p>TR. I know you have a good voice; don't shout so loud.</p>

<p>MIS. (<i>Louder.</i>) Hang it, but I <i>will</i> shout!</p>

<p>TR. (<i>Groans and glances over shoulder again.</i>) Run along home, there's a
good fellow. (<i>Urges him toward exit.</i>)", etc.</p>

<p>Tranio has a chance for very lively business: a sickly smile for the
usurer, lightning glances of apprehension towards Theopropides, with an
occasional intimate groan aside to the audience. Other farcical scenes of
the many that may be cited as calling for particularly vivacious business
and gesture are, e.g., <i>Cas.</i> 621 ff., where Pardalisca befools Lysidamus
by timely fainting, <i>Rud.</i> 414 ff., where Sceparnio flirts with Ampelisca,
and the quarrel scene, <i>Rud.</i> 485 ff.<sup><a href="#foot121">121</a></sup></p>

<p>The last four passages quoted in translation are by no means lacking in
artistic humor and a measure of reality, but they imply a pronounced
heightening of the actions and emotions of everyday life and lose their
humor unless presented in the broad spirit that stamps them as belonging
to the plane of farce. We now pass on to motives where the dialogue aims
at effects manifestly unnatural and where verisimilitude is sacrificed to
the joke, as we have seen it is in the employment of "bombast," "true
burlesque," etc.</p>

<p>The first of these motives is a stream of copious abuse, as in <i>Per.</i> 406
ff., where Toxilus <i>servos</i> and Dordalus <i>leno</i> exchange Rabelaisian
compliments.</p>

<p>"TOX. (<i>Hopping about with rabid gestures.</i>) You filthy pimp, you
mud-heap, you common dung-hill, you besmirched, corrupt, law-breaking
decoy, you public sewer, ... robber, mobber, jobber, ...!</p>

<p>DOR. (<i>Who has been dancing around in fury, shaking his fist until
exhausted by his paroxysms.</i>) Wait--till--(<i>Puffing</i>)--I--get--my
breath--I'll--answer you! You dregs of the rabble, you slave-brothel, you
'white-slave' freer, you sweat-of-the-lash, you chain gang, you king of
the treadmill, ... you eat-away, steal-away run-away....!" etc.<sup><a href="#foot122">122</a></sup></p>

<p>Perhaps we have here the forerunner of the shrewish wife in modern
vaudeville, who administers to her shrinking consort a rapid-fire
tongue-lashing. Another phase of this profuse riot of words appears in the
formidable Persian name that Sagaristio, disguised as a Persian, adopts in
the <i>Per.</i> (700 ff.):</p>

<p>"DORDALUS. What's your name?</p>

<p>SAG. Listen then, and you shall hear: False-speaker-us Girl-seller-son
Much-o'-nothing-talk-son Money-gouge-out-son Talk-up-to you-son
Coin-wheedle-out-son What-I-once-get-son Never-give-up-son: there you are!</p>

<p>DOR. (<i>With staring eyes and gasping breath.</i>) Ye Gods! That's a
variegated name of yours!</p>

<p>SAG. (<i>With a superior wave of the hand.</i>) It's the Persian fashion."</p>

<p>The second point in this category is own cousin to the above. We should
label it persistent interruption and repetition. An excellent instance is
<i>Trin.</i> 582 ff., when Stasimus, Lesbonicus and Philto have just hatched a
plot. Philto departs.</p>

<p>"LES. (<i>To Stasimus.</i>) You attend to my instructions. I'll be there
presently. Tell Callicles to meet me.</p>

<p>ST. Now you just clear out! (<i>Pushes him after Philto.</i>)</p>

<p>LES. (<i>Calls out as he is being shoved away.</i>) Tell him to see what has to
be done about the dowry.</p>

<p>ST. Clear out!</p>

<p>LES. (<i>Raising his voice.</i>) For I'm determined not to marry her off
without a dowry.</p>

<p>ST. Won't you clear out?</p>

<p>LES. (<i>Still louder.</i>) And I won't let her suffer harm by reason.----</p>

<p>ST. Get out, I say!</p>

<p>LES. (<i>Shouts.</i>)--of my carelessness.</p>

<p>ST. Clear out!</p>

<p>LES. It seems right that my own sins--</p>

<p>ST. Clear out!</p>

<p>LES.--should affect me alone.</p>

<p>ST. Clear out!</p>

<p>LES. (<i>Mock heroically.</i>) Oh father, shall I ever behold you again?</p>

<p>ST. Out, out, out! (<i>With a final shove.</i>) (<i>Exit Lesbonicus.</i>) At last, I
've got him away! (<i>Breathes hard.</i>)"</p>

<p>The fun, if fun there be, lies in the hammer-like repetition of "I modo,"
a sort of verbal buffoonery. A clever actor could din this with telling
effect. The device is employed several times. In <i>Most.</i> 974 ff. the word
is <i>aio</i>, in <i>Per.</i> 482 ff. <i>credo</i>, in <i>Poen.</i> 731 ff. <i>quippini</i>, in
<i>Ps.</i> 484 ff. &nu;&alpha;&iota; &gamma;&#940;&rho;, in <i>Rud.</i> 1212 ff. <i>licet</i> and 1269 ff.
<i>censeo</i>. The last two examples are the lengthiest.<sup><a href="#foot123">123</a></sup></p>

<p>The third of these motives is the introduction of clearly unnatural
dialogue, wholly incidental and foreign to the action, for the sake of
lugging in a joke. The <i>As.</i> (38 ff.) yields the following conversation
between Demaenetus <i>senex</i> and his slave Libanus:</p>

<p>"LI. By all that's holy, as a favor to me, spit out the words you have
uttered.</p>

<p>DE. All right, I'll be glad to oblige you. (<i>Coughs.</i>)</p>

<p>LI. Now, now, get it right up! (<i>Pats him on the back.</i>)</p>

<p>DE. More? (<i>Coughs.</i>)</p>

<p>LI. Gad, yes, please! Right from the bottom of your throat: more still!
(<i>Pats.</i>)</p>

<p>DE. Well, how far down then?</p>

<p>LI. (<i>Unguardedly.</i>) Down to Hades is my wish!</p>

<p>DE. I say, look out for trouble!</p>

<p>LI. (<i>Diplomatically.</i>) For your wife, I mean, not for you.</p>

<p>DE. For that speech I bestow upon you freedom from punishment."<sup><a href="#foot124">124</a></sup></p>

<p>The childish bandying of words in <i>Truc.</i> 858 ff. is egregiously tiresome
in the reading, but in action could have been made to produce a modicum of
amusement if presented in the broad burlesque spirit that we believe was
almost invariably employed. This gives us a clue to the next topic.</p>



<h4>B. <i>Devices absurd and inexplicable unless interpreted in a broad farcical
spirit.</i></h4>


<p>This includes peculiarities that have usually been commented on as
weaknesses or conventions, or else been given up as hopeless
incongruities, but which we hope to prove also yield their quota of
amusement if clownishly performed. The foremost of these is the famous</p>


<p align="center"><b>1. Running Slave or Parasite.</b></p>

<p>We all know him: rushing madly cross stage at top-speed (if we take the
literal word of the text for it), with girded loins, in search of somebody
right under his nose, the while unburdening himself of exhaustive periods
that, however great the breadth of the Roman stage, would carry him
several times across and back: as Curculio in 279 ff.:</p>

<p>"Make way for me, friends and strangers, while I carry out my duty here.
Run, all of you, scatter and clear the road! I'm in a hurry and I don't
want to butt into anybody with my head, or elbow, or chest, or knee....
And there's none so rich as can stand in my way, ... none so famous but
down he goes off the sidewalk and stands on his head in the street," and
so on for ten lines or more. After he has found his patron Phaedromus, he
is apparently so exhausted that he cries: "Hold me up, please, hold me up!
(<i>Wobbles and falls panting into Phaedromus' arms.</i>)</p>

<p>PH.... Get him a chair ... quick!"</p>

<p>When Leonida enters (<i>As.</i> 267 ff.) as the running slave, he is still out
of breath at 326-7! Stasimus in <i>Trin.</i> 1008 ff., though his mission is
also proclaimed as desperately urgent, pauses to declaim on public morals!</p>

<p>Considerable light has been thrown upon this subject recently by the
dissertation of Weissman, <i>De servi currentis persona apud comicos
Romanes</i> (Giessen, 1911), though his explanation of the <i>modus operandi</i>
is inconclusive. Langen has commented on it at some length,<sup><a href="#foot125">125</a></sup> but
offers no solution. Weise frankly admits:<sup><a href="#foot126">126</a></sup> "Wie sie gelaufen sind, ist
ein R&auml;tsel fur uns." LeGrand<sup><a href="#foot127">127</a></sup> follows Weise's conclusion that it is an
imitation from the Greek and in support of this instances Curculio's use,
while running, of the presumed translations from the Greek: <i>agoranomus</i>,
<i>demarchus</i>, etc. He also cites as parallels some unconvincing phrases from
fragments of New Comedy, while developing an ingenious theory that the
device is a heritage from the Greek orchestra, where it could have been
performed with a hippodrome effect. Terence berates the practice,<sup><a href="#foot128">128</a></sup> but
makes use of it himself.<sup><a href="#foot129">129</a></sup></p>

<p>Weissman's conclusions are worth a summary. He notes the following as the
usual essential concomitants: 1. It is mentioned in the text that the
slave is on the run. 2. He is the bearer of news of the moment; 3. He
fails to recognize other characters on stage; 4. He is halted by the very
man he is so violently seeking. He cites as the genuine occurrences of the
<i>servus</i> or <i>parasitus currens</i>, besides the passages mentioned above,
<i>Cap.</i> 781 ff., <i>Ep.</i> 1 ff., 192 ff., <i>Mer.</i> 111 ff., <i>Per.</i> 272 ff.,
<i>St.</i> 274 ff. Furthermore, he argues convincingly that this was an
independent Roman development without a prototype on the Greek stage and
neatly refutes Weise and LeGrand by proving that there are no extant Greek
fragments sufficient to furnish a ground for any but the most tenuous
argument. Above all, he correctly interprets the poet's aim with the
dictum: "Praeterquam quod hac persona optime utitur ad actionem bene
continuandam id maxime spectat ut per eam <i>spectatorum risum</i> captet." And
this from a German youth of twenty-two!</p>

<p>It is in his attempt to explain the mechanism that we believe Weissman
fails. He essays an exegesis of each passage, though the separate
explanations are naturally similar. It will suffice to quote one, that to
<i>As.</i> 267 ff.: "Hoc nullo modo aliter mihi declarari posse videtur nisi
sic: Oratio Leonidae currentis maior est quam ut arbitrari possimus
currentem semper eum habuisse eam. Ex versu 290 Leonidam de celeritate sua
remisisse plane apparet. Quod semel solum eum fecisse cum non satis mihi
esse videatur, saepius--bis vel ter--per breve tempus eum cursum suum
interrupisse, circumspexisse, Libanum autem non spectavisse (hoc consilium
poetae erat, licentia poetica est) et hoc modo per totam scaenam cursum
suum direxisse arbitror."</p>

<p>It will be observed that for lack of any tangible evidence he very
properly makes use of subjective reasoning. Now it has long been the
opinion of the writer that the maximum of comic effect (and that this was
the purpose of the <i>servus currens</i> there can surely be no doubt) could
best be obtained by the actor's making a violent and frenzied pretense of
running while scarcely moving from the spot. Consider the ludicrous
spectacle of the rapidly moving legs and the flailing arms, with the
actor's face turned toward the audience, as he declaims sonorously of his
haste to perform his vital errand, while making but a snail's progress.
Truly then his plea of exhaustion would not be without excuse! This is an
explanation at once simpler, more potentially comic, more in accord with
what we predicate as the spirit of Plautus, and furthermore we have seen
roars of laughter created by the similar device of a low comedian in a
modern extravaganza. Taking advantage of the same subjective license, we
see nothing in Weissman's theory to offset our opinion. But, what is more,
our subjective reconstruction is given color by a shred of tangible
evidence. Suetonius (<i>Tib.</i> 38) refers to a popular quip on the emperor
that compares him to an actor on the classic Greek stage: "Biennio
continuo post ademptum imperium pedem porta non extulit; ... ut vulgo iam
per iocum Callip(p)ides vocaretur, quem cursitare ac ne cubiti quidem
mensuram progredi proverbio Graeco notatum est." That this Callipides was
the &#x1F51;&pi;&omicron;&#x03D7;&rho;&iota;&tau;&#942;&sigmaf; mentioned by Xenophon (<i>Sym.</i> III. 11), Plutarch
(<i>Ages.</i> 21 and <i>Apophth. Lacon.</i>: s. v. <i>Ages.</i>), Cicyero (<i>Ad. Att.</i>
XIII. 12) and possibly by Aristotle (<i>Poet.</i> 26.), seems highly plausible.
Compare the <i>saltus fullonius</i> (Sen. <i>Ep.</i> 15.4).</p>

<p>Most amusing of all is Plautus' introduction of a parody on the parody,
when Mercury rushes in post-haste crying (<i>Amph.</i> 984 ff.):</p>

<p>"Make way, give way, everybody, clear the way! I tell you all: don't you
get so bold as to stand in my road. For, egad! I'd like to know why I, a
god, shouldn't have as much right to threaten the rabble as a mere slave
in the comedies!"</p>

<p>And perhaps <i>St.</i> 307 is a joke on the running slave: Sed spatium hoc
occidit: brevest curriculo: quam me paenitet? That violent haste was
considered a slavish trait is evidenced by <i>Poen.</i> 523-3.</p>


<p align="center"><b>2. Wilful blindness.</b></p>

<p>In the scene recently quoted (<i>Cur.</i> 279 ff.), Curculio, after his violent
exertions in search of his patron, is for a time apparently unable to
discover him, though he is on the stage all the time. This species of
blindness must be wilfully designed as a burlesque effect and again finds
its echo in low comedy types of today. The breadth and depth of the Roman
stage alone will not account for this either; indeed, its very size could
be utilized to heighten the humor, as the actor peers hither and yon in
every direction but the right one. So Curculio (front) may pass directly
by Phaedromus (rear) without seeing him, to the huge delight of the
audience, and turn back again, while saying (301 ff.):</p>

<p>"Is there anybody who can point out Phaedromus, my guardian angel, to me?
The matter's very urgent: I must find this chap at once.</p>

<p>PALINURUS. (<i>To Phaedromus.</i>) It's you he's looking for.</p>

<p>PH. What do you say we speak to him? Hello, Curculio, I want you!</p>

<p>CUR. (<i>Stopping and again looking vainly round.</i>) Who's calling? Who says
"Curculio"?</p>

<p>PH. Somebody that wants to see you.</p>

<p>CUR. (<i>At last recognizing him when almost on top of him.</i>) Ah! You don't
want to see me any more than I want to see you."</p>

<p>Acanthio in <i>Mer.</i> 130 ff. is still more blind to the presence of Charinus
and raises a deal more fuss, as he enters in the wildest haste looking for
Charinus, who is of course in plain sight. Acanthio, with labored
breathing and the remark that he would never make a piper, probably passes
by Charinus and goes to the house.</p>

<p>"AC. What am I standing here for, anyway? I'll make splinters of these
doors without a single qualm. (<i>Hammers violently. Charinus approaches,
vainly trying to attract his attention.</i>) Open up, somebody! Where's my
master Charinus, at home or out? (<i>Still hammering.</i>) Isn't anybody
supposed to have the job of tending door?</p>

<p>CH. (<i>Shouting.</i>) Here I am, Acanthio! You're looking for me, aren't you?</p>

<p>AC. (<i>Still punishing the door.</i>) I never saw such slovenly management.</p>

<p>CH. (<i>Finally grabbing and shaking him.</i>) What the deuce has got hold of
you?"<sup><a href="#foot130">130</a></sup> And so in the case of practically all the <i>servi currentes</i>.</p>

<p>The opening scene of the <i>Per.</i> (13 ff.) between two slaves apparently
unable to distinguish each other's features from opposite sides of the
stage affords an opportunity for a similar species of farcical by-play.
Toxilus and Sagaristio stroll slowly in from the different side-entrances,
alternately soliloquizing. Suddenly, when probably fairly close, both look
up and peer curiously at each other:</p>

<p>"TOX. (<i>Shading his eyes with his hand.</i>) Who's that standing over there?</p>

<p>SAG. Who's this standing over here?</p>

<p>TOX. Looks like Sagaristio.</p>

<p>SAG. I bet it's my friend Toxilus.</p>

<p>TOX. He's the fellow, all right.</p>

<p>SAG. That's the chap, I'm sure.</p>

<p>TOX. I'll go over to him.</p>

<p>SAG. I'll go up and speak to him. (<i>They draw closer.</i>)</p>

<p>TOX. Sagaristio, I hope the gods are good to you.</p>

<p>SAG. Toxilus, I hope the gods give you everything you want. How are you?</p>

<p>TOX. So so."<sup><a href="#foot131">131</a></sup></p>

<p>Note that this is <i>canticum</i> and the effect of the two "sing-songing"
slaves on the audience must have been much the same as, upon us, the
spectacle of a vaudeville "duo," entering from opposite wings and singing
perchance a burlesque of grand opera at each other.</p>


<p align="center"><b>3. Adventitious entrance.</b></p>

<p>This is of a piece with the above, but is usually due to a weakness of
composition, to the goddess &Tau;&#973;&chi;&eta;, who is the presiding deity of
the plots of New Comedy.<sup><a href="#foot132">132</a></sup> However, there are times when appreciable
fun can be extracted from this, if the actor speak in a bland jocular
tone, taking the audience into his confidence, as <i>Trin.</i> 400 f.:</p>

<p>"PHILTO. But the door of the house to which I was going is opening. Isn't
that nice? Lesbonicus, the very man I'm looking for, is coming out with
his slave."</p>

<p>And <i>Aul.</i> 176 f.:</p>

<p>"MEGADORUS. I'd like to see Euclio, if he's at home. Ah, here he comes!
He's on his way home from some place or other."<sup><a href="#foot133">133</a></sup></p>

<p>We believe that enough has been said to prove that the favorite devices of
the lower types of modern stage-production form the back-bone of Plautus'
methods of securing his comic effects. Let us pass on without more ado to
a discussion of points that establish equally well that he was careless of
every other consideration but the eliciting of laughter.</p>




<h3>II. Evidences of Loose Composition Which Prove a Disregard of Technique
and Hence Indicate that Entertainment Was the Sole Aim</h3>


<h4>A. <i>Solo speeches and passages</i>.</h4>


<p align="center"><b>1. Asides and soliloquies.</b></p>

<p>As it is often important for the audience to know the thoughts of stage
characters, the aside and the soliloquy in all species of dramatic
composition have always been recognized as the only feasible conventional
mode of conveying them. According to the strictest canons of dramatic art,
the ideally constructed play should be entirely free from this weakness.
Mr. Gillette is credited with having written in "Secret Service" the first
aside-less play. But this is abnormal and rather an affectation of
technical skill. The aside is an accepted convention. But in the plays of
Plautus we</p>

<p>have a profuse riot of solo speeches and passages that transcends the
conventional and becomes a gross weakness of composition, pointing plainly
to a poverty of technique and hence further strengthening the conception
of entertainment as the author's sole purpose. And often too, as we shall
point out, this very form can be used for amusement. To attempt a complete
collection of these passages would mean a citation of hundreds of lines,
comprising a formidable percentage of all the verses.</p>

<p>And furthermore, the Plautine character is not so tame and spiritless as
merely to think aloud. He has a fondness for actual conversation with
himself that shows a noble regard for the value of his own society. This
is attested by many passages, such as <i>Amph.</i> 381: Etiam muttis?; <i>Aul.</i>
52: At ut scelesta sola secum murmurat; <i>Aul.</i> 190: Quid tu solus tecum
loquere?; <i>Bac.</i> 773: Quis loquitur prope?; <i>Cap.</i> 133: Quis hic
loquitur?<sup><a href="#foot134">134</a></sup></p>

<p>One character standing aside and commenting on the main action is a
familiar situation and often productive of good fun. An excellent example
is <i>Most.</i> 166 ff., where Philematium is performing her conventionally
out-door toilet with the aid of her duenna Scapha. Philolaches stands on
the other side of the stage and interjects remarks:</p>

<p>"PHILEM. Look at me please, Scapha dear; is this gown becoming? I want to
please Philolaches, the apple of my eye....</p>

<p>SC. Why deck yourself out, when your charm lies in your charming manners?
It isn't gowns that lovers love, but what bellies out the gowns.</p>

<p>PHILO. (<i>Aside.</i>) God bless me, but Scapha's clever; the hussy has
horse-sense....</p>

<p>PHILEM. (<i>Pettishly.</i>) Well, then?</p>

<p>SC. What is it?</p>

<p>PHILEM. Look me over anyhow and see how this becomes me.</p>

<p>SC. The grace of your figure makes everything you wear becoming.</p>

<p>PHILO. (<i>Aside.</i>) Now for that speech, Scapha, I'll give you some present
before the day is out--and so on for a whole long scene.</p>

<p>The quips are amusing in an evident burlesque spirit. Such a scene was
easily done on the broad Roman stage, whether it was a heritage from the
use of the orchestra in Greek comedy, as LeGrand thinks,<sup><a href="#foot135">135</a></sup> or not. In
similar vein, clever by-play on the part of the cunning Palaestrio would
make a capital scene out of <i>Mil. 1037 ff.</i><sup><a href="#foot136">136</a></sup> A perfectly unnatural but
utterly amusing scene of the same type is <i>Amph. 153-262</i>, where Mercury
apostrophizes his fists, and the quaking Sosia (cross-stage) is frightened
to a jelly at the prospect of his early demise. In Cap. 966, Ilegio, staid
gentleman that he is, introduces an exceeding "rough" remark in the middle
of a serious scene. The aside of Pseudolus in <i>Ps. 636 f.</i> could be
rendered as a good-natured burlesque as follows:</p>

<p>"HARPAX. What's your name?</p>

<p>PS. (<i>Hopping forward and addressing audience with hand over mouth.</i>) The
pander has a slave named Surus. I'll say I'm he. (<i>Hopping back and
addressing Harpax.</i>) I'm Surus." Many other scenes were doubtless rendered
by one character's thus stepping aside and confiding his ideas to the
spectators, as for example <i>Aul. 194 ff.</i> and <i>Trin. 895 ff.</i> Often our
characters blurt out their inmost thoughts to the public, as in <i>Cas. 937
ff.</i>, with eavesdroppers conveniently placed, else what would become of
the plot?</p>

<p>The soliloquy is constantly used to keep the audience acquainted with the
advance of the plot<sup><a href="#foot137">137</a></sup>, or to paint in narrative intervening events that
connect the loose joints of the action. This is of course wholly
inartistic, but may often find its true office in keeping a noisy,
turbulent and uneducated audience aware of "what is going on." In many
cases the soliloquy is in the nature of a reflection on the action and
seems to bear all the ear-marks of a heritage from the original function
of the tragic chorus<sup><a href="#foot138">138</a></sup>. It devolved upon the actor by sprightly mimicry
to relieve, in these scenes, the tedium that appeals to the reader. So in
<i>Cap.</i> 909 ff. the <i>canticum</i> of the <i>puer</i> becomes more than a mere
stopgap, if he acts out vividly the violence of Ergasilus; and in <i>Bac.</i>
1067 ff. the soliloquy would acquire humor, if confidentially directed at
the audience. In <i>As.</i> 127 ff., as Argyrippus berates the <i>lena</i> within,
it must be delivered with an abundance of pantomime.</p>


<p align="center"><b>2. Lengthy monodies, monologues and episodical specialties.</b></p>

<p>Frequently the soliloquy takes the form of a long solo passage directed at
the audience, while the action halts for a whole scene to allow the actor
to regale his public with the poet's views on the sins of society,
economic topics of the day, or topics of the by-gone days in Athens, and
the like. The resemblance to the interpolated song and dance of musical
comedy is most striking. The comparison is the more apt, as about
two-thirds of the illustrative scenes referred to in the next paragraph
are in <i>canticum</i>. It is a pity that the comic chorus had disappeared, or
the picture were complete. That it is often on the actor's initial
appearance that he sings his song or speaks his piece, strengthens the
resemblance. But this is a natural growth under the influence of two
publics, the Greek and the Roman, notably fond of declamation and oratory.
LeGrand believes this a characteristic directly derived from a narrative
form of Middle Comedy embodied in certain extant fragments.<sup><a href="#foot139">139</a></sup></p>

<p>The slave class is the topic of many of these monodies: either the virtues
of the loyal slave are extolled<sup><a href="#foot140">140</a></sup>, or the knavery of the cunning
slave<sup><a href="#foot141">141</a></sup>. The parasite is "featured" too, when Ergasilus bewails the
decline of his profession<sup><a href="#foot142">142</a></sup>, or Peniculus and Gelasimus indulge in
haunting threnody on their perpetual lack of food<sup><a href="#foot143">143</a></sup>. Bankers, lawyers
and panders come in for their share of satire<sup><a href="#foot144">144</a></sup>. Our favorite topic
today, the frills and furbelows of woman's dress and its reform, held the
boards of ancient Athens and Rome<sup><a href="#foot145">145</a></sup>. In <i>Mil.</i> 637 ff, Periplecomenus
descants on the joys of the old bon vivant and the expense of a wife. The
delights or pains of love<sup><a href="#foot146">146</a></sup>, the ruminations of old age<sup><a href="#foot147">147</a></sup>, marriage
reform<sup><a href="#foot148">148</a></sup> and divorce<sup><a href="#foot149">149</a></sup>, the views of <i>meretrices</i> and their victims
on the arts of their profession<sup><a href="#foot150">150</a></sup>, the habits of cooks<sup><a href="#foot151">151</a></sup>, the pride
of valor and heroic deeds<sup><a href="#foot152">152</a></sup> are fruitful subjects. In <i>Cur.</i> 462 ff.
the <i>choragus</i> interpolates a recital composed of topical allusions to the
manners of different neighborhoods of Rome. We have two descriptions of
dreams<sup><a href="#foot153">153</a></sup>, and a clever bit which paints a likeness between a man and a
house<sup><a href="#foot154">154</a></sup>. In foreign vein is the lament of Palaestra in <i>Rud.</i> 185 ff.,
which sounds like an echo from tragedy. The appearance of the Fishermen's
Chorus (<i>Rud.</i> 290 ff.) is wholly adventitious and seems designed to
intensify the atmosphere of the seacoast, if indeed it has any purpose at
all. In this category also belong the revels of the drunken Pseudolus with
his song and dance<sup><a href="#foot155">155</a></sup>, and the final scene of the <i>St.</i><sup><a href="#foot156">156</a></sup>, where, the
action of the slender plot over, the comedy slaves royster and dance with
the harlot. When Ballio drives his herd before him, as he berates them
merrily to the tune of a whip, we have an energetic and effective
scene<sup><a href="#foot157">157</a></sup>.</p>

<p align="center"><b>3. Direct address of the audience.</b></p>

<p>It is a well-established principle that the most intimate cognizance of
the spectator's existence is a characteristic of the lowest types of
dramatic production (v. Part I, &sect; 1, fin.). The use of soliloquy, aside
and monologue all indicate the effort of the lines to put the player on
terms of intimacy with his public. But even this is transcended by the
frequent recurrence in jocular vein of deliberate, conscious and direct
address of the audience, when they are called by name. In <i>Truc.</i> 482
Stratophanes says: Ne expectetis, spectatores, meas pugnas dum
praedicem.... In <i>Poen Truc.</i> 597 we are told: Aurumst profecto hic,
spectatores, sed comicum; i. e., "stage-money." During a halt in the
action of the <i>Ps.</i> (573) we are graciously informed: Tibicen vos interibi
hic delectaverit. Mercury's comments (<i>Amph.</i> 449-550 passim), probably
with copious buffoonery, on the leave-taking of Jove and Alemena contain
the remark (507): Observatote, quam blande mulieri palpabitur. At the
close of the <i>Men.</i> (1157 ff.) Messenio announces an auction and invites
the spectators to attend.</p>

<p>When Euclio discovers the loss of his hoard, he rushes forth in wild
lament. In his extremity he turns to the audience (<i>Aul.</i> 715 ff.):</p>

<p>"EUC. I beg, I beseech, I implore you, help me and show me the man that
stole it. (<i>Picking out one of the spectators, probably a tough looking
"bruiser", and stretching out his hand to him.</i>) What do <i>you</i> say? I know
I can trust <i>you</i>. I can tell by your face you're honest. (<i>To the whole
audience, in response to the laughter sure to ensue.</i>) What's the matter?
What are you laughing at?" etc.</p>

<p>Moil&egrave;re has imitated this scene very closely in <i>L'Avare</i> (IV. 7), with a
super-Plautine profusion of verbiage.</p>

<p>In <i>Mil.</i> 200 ff. Periplecomenus obligingly acts as guide and personal
conductor to the manoeuvers of Palaestrio's mind, while it is in the
throes of evolving a stratagem. Palaestrio of course indulges in vivid,
pointed pantomime:</p>

<p>"PER. I'll step aside here awhile. (<i>To audience, pointing to
Palaestrio.</i>) Look yonder, please, how he stands with serried brow in
anxious contemplation. His fingers smite his breast; I trow, he fain would
summon forth his heart. Presto, change! His left hand he rests upon his
left thigh. With the fingers of his right he reckons out his scheme. Ha!
He whacks his right thigh!" etc.</p>

<p>It is very amusing too, when Jupiter in <i>Amph.</i> 861 ff. strolls in and
speaks his little piece to the pit:</p>

<p>"JUP. I am the renowned Amphitruo, whose slave is Sosia; you know, the
fellow that turns into Mercury at will. I dwell in my sky-parlor and
become Jupiter the while, ad libitum."<sup><a href="#foot158">158</a></sup></p>

<p>Even in olden times Euanthius censured this practice (<i>de Com.</i> III.
6)<sup><a href="#foot159">159</a></sup>: &lt;Terentius&gt; nihil ad populum facit actorem velut extra comoediam
loqui, quod vitium Plauti frequentissimum.</p>

<p>Naturally we shall hardly consider under this head the speech of the whole
<i>grex</i>, or the "Nunc plaudite" of an actor that closes a number of the
plays. It is no more than the bowing or curtain-calls of today<sup><a href="#foot160">160</a></sup>,
unless it was an emphatic announcement to the audience that the play was
over.</p>



<h4>B. <i>Inconsistencies and carelessness of composition</i>.</h4>

<p>We have referred above to the voluminous mass of inconsistencies,
contradictions and psychological improbabilities collected by Langen in
his <i>Plautinische Studien</i>. He really succeeds in finding the crux of the
situation in recognizing that these features are inherent in Plautus'
style and are frequently employed solely for comic effect, though he is
often overcome by a natural Teutonic stolidity. He aptly points out that
Plautus in his selection of originals has in the main chosen plots with
more vigorous action than Terence. We shall have occasion to quote him at
intervals, but desire to develop this topic quite independently.</p>


<p align="center"><b>1. Pointless badinage and padded scenes.</b></p>

<p>Strong evidence of loose construction and lack of a technical dramatic
ideal is contained in the large number of scenes padded out with pointless
badinage, often tiresome, often wholly episodical in nature, as the
monodies, and putting for a time a complete check on the plot. The most
striking of these is <i>Aul.</i> 631 ff., when Euclio, suspecting Strobilus of
the theft of his gold, pounces upon him and belabors him:</p>

<p>"STR. (<i>Howling and dancing and making violent efforts to free himself.</i>)
What the plague has got hold of you? What have you to do with me, you
dotard? Why pick on me? Why are you grabbing me? Don't beat me! (<i>Succeeds
in breaking loose.</i>)</p>

<p>EUC. (<i>Shaking stick at him.</i>) You first-class jailbird, do you dare ask
me again? You're not a thief, but three thieves rolled into one!</p>

<p>STR. (<i>Whining and nursing bruises</i>) What did I steal from you?</p>

<p>EUC. (<i>Still threatening.</i>) Give it back here, I say?</p>

<p>STR. (<i>Trembling and edging off.</i>) What is it you want me to give back?</p>

<p>EUC. (<i>Watching him narrowly.</i>) You ask?</p>

<p>STR. I tell you, I didn't take a thing from you.</p>

<p>EUC. (<i>Impatiently.</i>) All right, but hand over what you did take!
(<i>Pause.</i>) Well, well!</p>

<p>STR. Well, what?</p>

<p>EUC. You can't get away with it.</p>

<p>STR. (<i>Bolder.</i>) Look here, what do you want?...</p>

<p>EUC. (<i>Angrier and angrier.</i>) Hand it over, I say! Stop quibbling! I'm not
trifling now!</p>

<p>STR. Now what shall I hand over? Speak out! Why don't you give the thing a
name? I swear I never touched or handled anything of yours.</p>

<p>EUC. Put out your hands.</p>

<p>STR. There you are! I've done so. See them?</p>

<p>EUC. (<i>Scrutinizing his hands closely.</i>) All right. Now put out the third
too.</p>

<p>STR. (<i>Aside, growing angry.</i>) The foul fiends of madness have possessed
this doddering idiot. (<i>Majestically.</i>) Confess you wrong me?</p>

<p>EUC. (<i>Dancing in frenzy.</i>) To the utmost, since I don't have you strung
up! And that's what'll happen too, if you don't confess.</p>

<p>STR. (<i>Shouting.</i>) Confess what?</p>

<p>EUC. What did you steal from here? (<i>Pointing to his house.</i>)</p>

<p>STR. Strike me if I stole anything of yours, (<i>Aside to audience</i>) and if
I don't wish I'd made off with it.</p>

<p>EUC. Come now, shake out your cloak.</p>

<p>STR. (<i>Doing so.</i>) As you please.</p>

<p>EUC. (<i>Stooping to see if anything falls out.</i>) Haven't got it under your
shirt? (<i>Pounces upon him and ransacks clothing.</i>)</p>

<p>STR. (<i>Resignedly.</i>) Search me, if you like;" and so on with "Give it
back," What is it? "Put out your right hand," etc., etc.</p>

<p>Moli&egrave;re again imitated almost slavishly (<i>L'Avare</i>, V. 3). Longwinded as
the thing is, it is clear that the liveliness of the action not only
relieves it, but could make it immensely amusing. At least it is superior
to the average vaudeville skit of the present day. It must not be
forgotten too that, as Plautus was in close touch with his players, he
could have done much of the stage-directing himself and might even have
worked up some parts to fit the peculiar talents of certain actors, as is
regularly done in the modern "tailormade drama."</p>

<p>There are numbers of scenes of the sort quoted above, where the apparent
monotony and verbal padding could be converted into coin for laughter by
the clever comedian. <i>Amph.</i> 551-632 could be worked up poco a poco
crescendo e animato; in <i>Poen.</i> 504 ff., Agorastocles and the <i>Advocati</i>
bandy extensive rhetoric; in <i>Trin.</i> 276 ff., the action is suspended
while Philto proves himself Polonius' ancestor in his long-winded
sermonizing to Lysiteles and his insistent <i>laudatio temporis acti</i>; in
<i>St.</i> 326 ff., as Pinacium, the <i>servus currens</i>, finally succeeds in
"arriving" out of breath (he has been running since 274), bursting with
the vast importance of his news, he postpones the delivery of his tidings
till 371 while he indulges in irrelevant badinage. This is pure
buffoonery. And we can instance scene upon scene where the self-evident
padding can either furnish an excuse for agile histrionism, or become
merely tiresome in its iteration<sup><a href="#foot161">161</a></sup>. The danger of the latter was even
recognized by our poet, when, at the end of much word-fencing, Acanthio
asks Charinus if his desire to talk quietly is prompted by fear of waking
"the sleeping spectators" (<i>Mer.</i> 160). This was probably no exaggeration.</p>

<p>When the padding takes the form of mutual "spoofing," the scene assumes an
uncanny likeness to the usual lines of a modern "high-class vaudeville
duo." Note Leonida and Libanus, the merry slaves of the <i>As.</i> in 297 ff.,
Toxilus and Sagaristio in the <i>Per.</i>, Milphio and Syncerastus in the
<i>Poen.</i> (esp. 851 ff.), Pseudolus and Simia in <i>Ps.</i> 905 ff., Trachalio
and Gripus in <i>Rud.</i> 938 ff., Stichus and Sagarinus in the final scene of
the <i>St.</i>, and in <i>Ps.</i> 1167 ff. Harpax is unmercifully "chaffed" by Simo
and Ballio. Or, in view of the surrounding drama, we might better compare
these roysterers to the "team" of low comedians often grafted on a musical
comedy, where their antics effectually prevent the tenuous plot from
becoming vulgarly prominent.</p>

<p align="center"><b>2. Inconsistencies of character and situation.</b></p>

<p>The Plautine character is never a consistent human character. He is rather
a personified trait, a broad caricature on magnified foibles of some type
of mankind. There is never any character development, no chastening. We
leave our friends as we found them. They may exhibit the outward
manifestation of grief, joy, love, anger, but their marionette nature
cannot be affected thereby. That we should find inconsistencies in
character portrayal under these circumstances, is not only to be expected,
but is a mathematical certainty. The poet cares not; they must only dance,
dance, dance!</p>

<p>Persistent moralizers, such as Megaronides in the <i>Trin.</i>, who serve but
as a foil from whom the revelry "sticks fiery off," descend themselves at
moments to bandying the merriest quips (Scene I.). In <i>Ep.</i> 382 ff., the
moralizing of Periphanes is counterfeit coinage. Gilded youths such as
Calidorus of the <i>Ps.</i> begin by asking (290 f.): "Could I by any chance
trip up father, who is such a wide-awake old boy?", and end by rolling
their eyes upward with: "And besides, if I could, filial piety prevents."
The Menaechmi twins are eminently respectable, but they cheerfully purloin
mantles, bracelets and purses. Hanno of the <i>Poen.</i> should according to
specifications be a staid <i>pater familias</i>, but Plautus imputes to him a
layer of the <i>Punica fides</i> that he knew his public would take delight in
"booing." And the old gentleman enters into a plot (1090) to chaff
elaborately his newly-found long-lost daughters, whom he has spent a
lifetime in seeking, before disclosing his identity to them (1211 ff.).
Saturio's daughter in the <i>Per.</i> is at one time the very model of maidenly
modesty and wisdom (336 ff.), at others an accomplished intriguante and
demi-mondaine (549 ff., esp. 607 ff.). When the plot of the <i>Ep.</i> is
getting hopelessly tangled, of a sudden it is magically resolved as by a
deus ex machina and everybody decides to "shake and make up."</p>

<p>Slaves ever fearful of the mills or quarries are yet prone to the most
abominable "freshness" towards their masters. The irrepressible Pseudolus
in reading a letter from Calidorus' mistress says (27 ff.):</p>

<p>"What letters! Humph! I'm afraid the Sibyl is the only person capable of
interpreting these.</p>

<p>"CAL. Oh why do you speak so rudely of those lovely letters written on a
lovely tablet with a lovely hand?</p>

<p>"PS. Well, would you mind telling me if hens have hands? For these look to
me very like hen-scratches.</p>

<p>"CAL. You insulting beast! Read, or return the tablet!</p>

<p>"PS. Oh, I'll read all right, all right. Just focus your mind on this.</p>

<p>"CAL. <i>(Pointing vacantly to his head.</i>) Mind? It's not here.</p>

<p>"PS. What! Go get one quick then!<sup><a href="#foot162">162</a></sup>."</p>

<p>In order that the machinations of these cunning slaves may mature, it is
usually necessary to portray their victims as the veriest fools. Witness
the cock-and-bull story by which Stasimus, in <i>Trin.</i> 515 ff., convinces
Philto that his master's land is an undesirable real estate prospect.
Dordalus in <i>Per.</i> (esp. 493 ff.) exhibits a certain amount of caution in
face of Toxilus' "confidence game," but that he should be victimized at
all stamps him as a caricature.</p>

<p>LeGrand is certainly right in pronouncing the cunning slave a pure
convention, adapted from the Greek and so unsuitable to Roman society that
even Plautus found it necessary to apologize for their unrestrained
gambols, on the ground that 'that was the way they did in Athens!'<sup><a href="#foot163">163</a></sup></p>

<p>Certain of the characters are caricatures <i>par excellence</i>, embodiments of
a single attribute. Leaena of the <i>Cur.</i> is the perpetually thirsty
<i>lena</i>: "Wine, wine, wine!"<sup><a href="#foot164">164</a></sup> Cleaerata of the <i>As.</i> is a plain
caricature, but is exceptionally cleverly drawn as the <i>lena</i> with the
mordant tongue. Phronesium's thirst in the <i>Truc.</i>, is gold, gold, gold!
The <i>danista</i> of the <i>Most.</i> finds the whole expression of his nature in
the cry of "Faenus!"<sup><a href="#foot165">165</a></sup> Assuredly, he is the progenitor of the modern
low-comedy Jew: "I vant my inderesd!" Calidorus of the <i>Ps.</i> and
Phaedromus of the <i>Cur.</i> are but bleeding hearts dressed up in clothes.
The <i>milites gloriosi</i> are all cartoons;<sup><a href="#foot166">166</a></sup> and the perpetually
moralizing pedagogue Lydus of the <i>Bac.</i> becomes funny, instead of
egregiously tedious, if acted as a broad burlesque.</p>

<p>The panders<sup><a href="#foot167">167</a></sup> are all manifest caricatures, too, especially the famous
Ballio of the <i>Ps.</i>, whom even Lorenz properly describes as "der
Einbegriff aller Schlechtigkeit," though he deprecates the part as "eine
etwas zu grell and zu breit angefuhrte Schilderung."<sup><a href="#foot168">168</a></sup> "Ego scelestus,"
says Ballio himself.<sup><a href="#foot169">169</a></sup> He calmly and unctuously pleads guilty to every
charge of "liar, thief, perjurer," etc., and can never be induced to lend
an ear until the cabalistic charm "Lucrum!" is pronounced (264).</p>

<p>The famous miser Euclio has given rise to an inordinate amount of
unnecessary comment. Lamarre<sup><a href="#foot170">170</a></sup> is at great pains to defend Plautus from
"le reproche d'avoir introduit dans la peinture de son principal
personnage &lt;Euclio&gt; des traits outres et hors de nature." Indeed, he
possesses few traits in accord with normal human nature. But curiously
enough, as we learn from the <i>argumenta</i> (in view of the loss of the
genuine end of the <i>Aul.</i>), Euclio at the <i>denouement</i> professes himself
amply content to bid an everlasting farewell to his stolen hoard, and
bestows his health and blessing on "the happy pair." This apparent
conversion, with absolutely nothing dramatic to furnish an introduction or
pretext for it, has caused Langen to depart from his usual judicious
scholarship. After much hair-splitting he solemnly pronounces it
"psychologically possible."<sup><a href="#foot171">171</a></sup> LeGrand points out<sup><a href="#foot172">172</a></sup> that his change
of heart is not a conversion, but merely a professed reconciliation to the
loss. But there is no need for all this pother. The simple truth is that
Plautus was through with his humorous complication and was ready to top it
off with a happy ending. It is the forerunner of modern musical comedy,
where the grouchy millionaire papa is propitiated at the last moment
(perhaps by the pleadings of the handsome widow), and similarly consents
to his daughter's marriage with the handsome, if impecunious, ensign.</p>


<p align="center"><b>3. Looseness of dramatic construction.</b></p>

<p>Lorenz with commendable insight has pointed out<sup><a href="#foot173">173</a></sup> that &Tau;&#973;&chi;&eta;,
the goddess of Chance, is the motive power of the Plautine plot, as
distinguished from the &mu;&omicron;&#x1FD6;&rho;&alpha; of tragedy. A student of Plautus
readily recognizes this point. The entire development of the <i>Rud.</i> and
<i>Poen.</i> exemplifies it in the highest degree. Hanno in the <i>Poen.</i>, in
particular, meets first of all, in the strange city of Calydon, the very
man he is looking for! When Pseudolus is racking his wits for a stratagem,
Harpax obligingly drops in with all the requisites. The ass-dealer in the
<i>As.</i> is so ridiculously fortuitous that it savors of childlike naivet&eacute;.</p>

<p>Characters are perpetually entering just when wanted. We hear "Optume
advenis" and "Eccum ipsum video" so frequently that they become as
meaningless as "How d'ye do!"<sup><a href="#foot174">174</a></sup>; though, as shown above<sup><a href="#foot175">175</a></sup>, even this
very weakness could at moments be made the pretext for a mild laugh.</p>

<p>For a complete catalogue of the formidable mass of inconsistencies and
contradictions that throng the plays, the reader is referred to the
<i>Plautinische Studien</i> of Langen, as aforesaid. It will be of passing
interest to recall one or two. In <i>Cas.</i> 530 Lysidamus goes to the "forum"
and returns <i>32 verses later</i> complaining that he has wasted the whole day
standing "advocate" for a kinsman. But this difficulty is resolved, if we
accept the theory of Prof. Kent (TAPA. XXXVII), that the change of acts
which occurs in between, is a conventional excuse for any lapse of time,
in Roman comedy as well as in Greek tragedy. But it is extremely doubtful
that Prof. Kent succeeds in establishing the truth of this view in the
case of Roman comedy. We see no convincing reason for departing from the
accepted theory, as expressed by Duff (<i>A Literary History of Rome</i>, pp.
196-7): "In Plautus' time a play proceeded continuously from the lowering
of the curtain at the beginning to its rise at the end, save for short
breaks filled generally by simple music from the <i>tibicen</i> (<i>Ps.</i> 573). The
division into scenes is ancient and regularly indicated in manuscripts of
Plautus and Terence."</p>

<p>Langen seems surprised<sup><a href="#foot176">176</a></sup> when Menaechmus Sosicles, on beholding his
twin for the first time (<i>Men.</i> 1062), though he was the object of a six
years' search, wades through some twenty lines of amazed argument before
Messenio (with marvelous cunning!) hits on the true explanation. It is of
course conceived in a burlesque spirit. What would become of the comic
action if Menaechmus II simply walked up to Menaechmus I and remarked:
"Hello, brother, don't you remember me?"</p>

<p>That the seven months of <i>Most.</i> 470 miraculously change into six months
in 954 is the sort of mistake possible to any writer. In the <i>Amph.</i> 1053
ff., Alcmena is in labor apparently a few minutes after consorting with
Jupiter; but the change of acts <i>may</i> account for the lapse of time, here
as in <i>Cas.</i> 530 ff.</p>

<p>But after the exhaustive work of Langen, we need linger no longer in this
well-ploughed field. We repeat, the evidence all points irresistibly to
the conclusion that Plautus is wholly careless of his dramatic machinery
so long as it moves. The laugh's the thing!</p>

<p>The <i>St.</i> is an apt illustration of the probable workings of Plautus'
mind. The virtue of the Penelope-like Pamphila and Panegyris proves too
great a strain and unproductive of merriment. The topic gradually vanishes
as the drolleries of the parasite Gelasimus usurp the boards. He in turn
gives way to the hilarious buffoonery of the two slaves. The result is a
succession of loose-jointed scenes<sup><a href="#foot177">177</a></sup>. The <i>Aul.</i> too is fragmentary and
episodical. The <i>Trin.</i> is insufferably long-winded, with insufficient
comic accompaniment. The <i>Cis.</i> is a wretched piece of vacuous
inanity<sup><a href="#foot178">178</a></sup>.</p>


<p align="center"><b>4. Roman admixture and topical allusions.</b></p>

<p>Plautus' frequent forgetfulness of his Greek environment and the
interjection of Roman references--what De Quincey calls "anatopism"--is
another item of careless composition too well known to need more than
passing mention. The repeated appearance of the <i>Velabrum,</i><sup><a href="#foot179">179</a></sup> or
<i>Capitolium,</i><sup><a href="#foot180">180</a></sup> or <i>circus,</i><sup><a href="#foot181">181</a></sup> or <i>senatus</i>, or <i>dictator</i>,<sup><a href="#foot182">182</a></sup> or
<i>centuriata comitio,</i><sup><a href="#foot183">183</a></sup> or <i>plebiscitum,</i><sup><a href="#foot184">184</a></sup> and a host of others in
the Greek investiture, becomes after a while a matter of course to us. We
see however no need to quarrel with <i>forum</i>; it was Plautus' natural
translation for &#x1F00;&gamma;&omicron;&rho;&#940;. But it all adds inevitably and
relentlessly to our argument--Plautus was heedless of the petty demands of
technique and realism. His attention was too much occupied in devising
means of amusement.</p>

<p>The occasional topical allusions belong in the same category as above; for
example, the allusion to the Punic war (<i>Cis.</i> 202),<sup><a href="#foot185">185</a></sup> the <i>lex
Platoria</i> (<i>Ps.</i> 303, <i>Rud.</i> 1381-2), Naevius' imprisonment (<i>Mil. </i>
211-2), Attalus of Pergamum (<i>Per.</i> 339, <i>Poen.</i> 664), Antiochus the Great
(<i>Poen.</i> 693-4). Again we have a modern parallel: the topics of the day
are a favorite resort of the lower types of present-day stage production.</p>


<p align="center"><b>5. Jokes on the dramatic machinery.</b></p>

<p>But the most extreme stage of intimate jocularity is reached when the last
sorry pretense of drama is discarded and the dramatic machinery itself
becomes the subject of jest. So in the <i>Cas.</i> 1006 the cast is warned:
Hanc ex longa longiorem ne faciamus fabulam. In <i>Per.</i> 159-60 Saturio
wants to know where to get his daughter's projected disguise:</p>

<p>"SAT. &pi;&#972;&theta;&epsilon;&nu; ornamenta?</p>

<p>TOX. Abs chorago sumito. Dare debet: praebenda aediles locaverunt." (Cf.
<i>Trin.</i> 858.)</p>

<p>Even the <i>Ps.</i>, heralded as dramatically one of the best of the plays,
yields the following: Horum caussa haec agitur spectatorum fabula (720);
hanc fabulam dum transigam (562) and following speech; verba quae in
comoediis solent lenoni dici (1081-2); quam in aliis comoediis fit (1240);
quin vocas spectatores simul? (1332). In <i>St.</i> 715 ff., the action of the
play is interrupted while the boisterous slaves give the musician a drink.
From the <i>Poen.</i> comes a gem that will bear quoting at length (550 ff.):</p>

<blockquote>  Omnia istaec scimus iam nos, si hi spectatores sciant.<br />
Horunc hic nunc causa haec agitur spectatorum fabula:<br />
Hos te satius est docere ut, quando agas, quid agas sciant.<br />
Nos tu ne curassis: scimus rem omnem, quippe omnes simul.<br />
Didicimus tecum una, ut respondere possimus tibi.<sup><a href="#foot186">186</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>This is the final degeneration into the realm of pure foolery. It is a
patent declaration: "This is only a play; laugh and we are content." Once
more we venture to point a parallel on the modern stage, in the vaudeville
comedian who interlards his dancing with comments such as: "I hate to do
this, but it's the only way I can earn a living."</p>

<p align="center"><b>6. Use of stock plots and characters.</b></p>

<p>We must touch finally, but very lightly, on the commonplaces of stock
plots and characters. The whole array of puppets is familiar to us all:
the cunning slave, the fond or licentious papa, the spendthrift son and
their inevitable confr&egrave;res appear in play after play with relentless
regularity. The close correspondence of many plots is also too familiar to
need discussion.<sup><a href="#foot187">187</a></sup> The glimmering of originality in the plot of the
<i>Cap.</i> called for special advertisement.<sup><a href="#foot188">188</a></sup> In the light of the
foregoing evidence, the pertinence of these facts for us, we reiterate, is
that Plautus merely adopted the New Comedy form as his comic medium, and,
while leaving his originals in the main untouched, took what liberties he
desired with them, with the single-minded purpose of making his public
laugh.<sup><a href="#foot189">189</a></sup></p>




<h2>In Conclusion</h2>



<p>In contrast to these grotesqueries certain individual scenes and plays
stand out with startling distinctness as possessed of wit and humor of
high order. The description by Cleaereta of the relations of lover,
mistress and <i>lena</i> is replete with biting satire (<i>As.</i> 177 ff., 215
ff.). The finale of the same play is irresistibly comic. In <i>Aul. </i> 731
ff. real sparks issue from the verbal cross-purposes of Euclio and
Lyconides over the words "pot" and "daughter." The <i>Bac.</i> is an excellent
play, marred by padding. When the sisters chaff the old men as "sheep"
(1120 ff.), the humor is naturalistic and human. The <i>Cas.</i>, uproarious
and lewd as it is, becomes excruciatingly amusing if the mind is open to
appreciating humor in the broadest spirit. The discourse of Periplecomenus
(<i>Mil.</i> 637 ff.) is marked by homely satirical wisdom. In the <i>Ps.</i> the
badinage of the name-character is appreciably superior to most of the
incidental quips. Pseudolus generously compliments Charinus on beating him
at his own game of repartee (743). When Weise (<i>Die Komodien des Plautus</i>,
p. 181) describes <i>Ps.</i> IV. 7 as "eine der ausgezeichnetsten Scenen, die
es irgend giebt," his superlative finds a better justification than usual.</p>

<p>When Menaechmus Sosicles sees fit "to put an antic disposition on," we
have a scene which, while eminently farcical, is signally clever and
dramatically effective. Witness the imitation by Shakespeare in <i>The
Comedy of Errors</i>, IV. 4, and in spirit by modern farce; for instance, in
<i>A Night Off</i>, when the staid old Professor feels the recrudescence of his
youthful aspirations to attend a prize-fight, he simulates madness as a
prelude to dashing wildly away.</p>

<p>The following from <i>Rud.</i> (160 ff.) is theatrical but tremendously
effective and worthy of the highest type of drama. Sceparnio, looking
off-stage, spies Ampelisca and Palaestra tossed about in a boat. He
addresses Daemones:

"SC. But O Palaemon! Hallowed comrade of Neptune ... what scene meets my
eye?</p>

<p>DAE. What do you see?</p>

<p>SC. I see two poor lone women sitting in a bit of a boat. How the poor
creatures are being tossed about! Hoorah! Hoorah! Fine! The waves are
whirling their boat past the rocks into the shallows. A pilot couldn't
have steered straighter. I swear I never saw waves more high. They're safe
if they escape those breakers. Now, now, danger! One is overboard! Ah, the
water's not deep: she'll swim out in a minute. Hooray! See the other one,
how the wave tossed her out! She is up, she's on her way shoreward; she's
safe!"</p>

<p>Sceparnio clasps his hands, jumps up and down, grasps the shaking Daemones
convulsively and communicates his excitement to the audience. It is a
piece of thrilling theatrical declamation and must have wrought the
spectators up to a high pitch. In general, the <i>Rud.</i> is a superior play.</p>

<p>In <i>Cas.</i> 229 ff. there is developed a piece of faithful and entertaining
character-drawing, as the old rou&eacute; Lysidamus fawns upon his militant
spouse Cleostrata, with the following as its climax:</p>

<p>"CLE. (<i>Sniffling.</i>) Ha! Whence that odor of perfumes, eh?</p>

<p>LYS. The jig's up."</p>

<p>In the whole panorama of Plautine personae the portrayal of Alcmena in the
<i>Amph.</i> is unique, for she is drawn with absolute sincerity and speaks
nothing out of character. Certainly no parody can be made out of the nobly
spoken lines 633-52, which lend a genuine air of tragedy to the professed
<i>tragi(co)comoedia</i> (59, 63); unless we think of the lady's unwitting
compromising condition (surely too subtle a thought for the original
audience). Note also the exalted tone of 831-4, 839-42. But all through
this scene Sosia is prancing around, prating nonsense, and playing the
buffoon, so that perchance even here the nobility becomes but a foil for
the revelry. And in 882-955 his royal godship Jove clowns it to the lady's
truly minted sentiments.</p>

<p>No, we are far from attempting to deny to Plautus all dramatic technique,
skill in character painting and cleverness of situation, but he was never
hide-bound by any technical considerations. He felt free to break through
the formal bonds of his selected medium at will. He had wit, esprit and
above all a knowledge of his audience; and of human nature generally, or
else he could not have had such a trenchant effect on the literature of
all time.</p>

<p>At any rate, the above lonely landmarks cannot affect our comprehensive
estimate of the mise-en-sc&egrave;ne. Enough has been said, we believe, in our
discussion of the criticism and acting and in our analysis of his dramatic
values, to show that the aberrations of Plautus' commentators have been
due to their failure to reach the crucial point: the absolute license with
which his plays were acted and intended to be acted is at once the
explanation of their absurdities and deficiencies. This was true in a far
less degree of Terence, who dealt in plots more <i>stataria</i> and less
<i>motoria</i>.<sup><a href="#foot190">190</a></sup> Though using the same store of models, he endeavored to
produce an artistically constructed play, which should make some honest
effort to "hold the mirror up to nature." We are convinced that even his
extensive use of <i>contaminatio</i> was designed to evolve a better plot. The
extravagance of Plautus is toned down in Terence to a reasonable
verisimilitude and a far more "gentlemanly" mode of fun-making that was
appropriate to one in the confidence of the aristocratic Scipionic circle.
But when all is said and done, Terence lacks the vivid primeval
"Volkswitz" of Plautus. We dare only skirt the edges of this extensive
subject.<sup><a href="#foot191">191</a></sup></p>

<p>Above all, our noble jester <i>succeeds</i> in his mission of laugh-producing.
But his methods are not possessed in the main of dramatic respectability.
And it must be apparent that our analysis and citations have covered the
bulk of the plays.</p>

<p>We conclude then that the prevalence of inherent defects of composition
and the lack of serious motive, coupled with the author's constant and
conscious employment of the implements of broad farce and extravagant
burlesque, impel us inevitably to the conclusion that we have before us a
species of composition which, while following a dramatic form, is not
inherently drama, but a variety of entertainment that may be described as
a compound of comedy, farce and burlesque; while the accompanying music,
which would lend dignity to tragedy or grand opera, merely heightens the
humorous effect and lends the color of musical comedy or opera
bouffe.<sup><a href="#foot192">192</a></sup> K&ouml;rting is right in calling it mere entertainment, Mommsen is
right in calling it caricature, but we maintain that it is professedly
mere entertainment, that it is consciously caricature and if it fulfills
these functions we have no right to criticise it on other grounds. If we
attempt a serious critique of it as drama, we have at once on our hands a
capricious mass of dramatic unrealities and absurdities: bombast,
burlesque, extravagance, horse-play, soliloquies, asides, direct address
of the audience, pointless quips, and so on. The minute we accept it as a
consciously conceived medium for amusement only, we have a highly
effective theatrical mechanism for the unlimited production of laughter.
And, in fact, every shred of evidence, however scant, goes to show that
the histrionism must have been conceived in a spirit of extreme
liveliness, abandon and extravagance in gesture and declamation, that
would not confine the actor to faithful portrayal in character, but would
allow him scope and license to resort to any means whatsoever to bestir
laughter amongst a not over-stolid audience.</p>

Ritschl, <i>Par.</i> 271, etc. The efforts to distinguish Plautus from his
models have so far been fragmentary and abortive and will not advance
appreciably until a complete play that he adapted has been found. At any
rate, the discussion has no real bearing on our subject, since we can
consider only the plays as actually transmitted; their sources cannot
affect our argument. The comparisons in <i>Daos</i> seem to indicate that
Plautus did not debase his originals so much as Mommsen, K&ouml;rting, Schlegel
and others had thought. Even in 1881, Kiessling (<i>Anal. Plaut.</i> II.
9) boldly expresses the opinion: "Atque omnino Plautus multo pressius

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
